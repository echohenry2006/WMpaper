AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar I disorder (BD) share many overlapping
      clinical features, confounding the current diagnostic systems. Recent studies
      suggest the posterior cingulate (PCC) and medial prefrontal (MPFC) cortices that 
      are involved in SZ and BD pathophysiology. However, the roles of PCC and MPFC in 
      providing specific distinctive and shared neural substrates between these two
      disorders remain largely unknown. Examining the neurophysiologic mechanism of
      these diseases may help explain the clinical observations and differentiate the
      two disorders. METHODS: We used the Dynamic Casual Modeling (DCM), which is
      capable of eliciting hidden neuronal dynamics and reveal cross-regulation of
      multiple neuronal systems, to characterize the pattern of disrupted effective
      connectivity in the left PCC-MPFC circuit during working memory tasks in 36 SZ
      and 20 BD patients as well as 29 healthy controls. RESULTS: Compared to the
      healthy controls, both SZ and BD patient groups exhibited significant negative
      effective connectivity from the left MPFC to PCC. The negative effective
      connectivity was more remarkable in schizophrenic patients. Only patients with BD
      differed from healthy controls with positive effective connectivity from the left
      PCC to MPFC. CONCLUSIONS: Whole brain analysis revealed deactivation of the left 
      PCC and MPFC across all patient groups. This study provides new insight that
      changes in effective connectivity of the left MPFC to left PCC circuit during
      working memory processing may be a core pathophysiological feature distinguishing
      SZ from BD.

AB  - Functional interactions between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
      hippocampus during working memory have been studied extensively as an
      intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. Coupling abnormalities have been found 
      in patients, their unaffected siblings, and carriers of common genetic variants
      associated with schizophrenia, but the global genetic architecture of this
      imaging phenotype is unclear. To achieve genome-wide hypothesis-free
      identification of genes and pathways associated with prefrontal-hippocampal
      interactions, we combined gene set enrichment analysis with whole-genome
      genotyping and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 269 healthy German
      volunteers. We found significant enrichment of the synapse organization and
      biogenesis gene set. This gene set included known schizophrenia risk genes, such 
      as neural cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, 
      beta 2 subunit (CACNB2), as well as genes with well-defined roles in
      neurodevelopmental and plasticity processes that are dysfunctional in
      schizophrenia and have mechanistic links to prefrontal-hippocampal functional
      interactions. Our results demonstrate a readily generalizable approach that can
      be used to identify the neurogenetic basis of systems-level phenotypes. Moreover,
      our findings identify gene sets in which genetic variation may contribute to
      disease risk through altered prefrontal-hippocampal functional interactions and
      suggest a link to both ongoing and developmental synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The anterior insula is a multifunctional region involved in various cognitive,
      perceptual and socio-emotional processes. In particular, a portion of the left
      anterior insula is closely associated with working memory processes in healthy
      participants and shows gray matter reduction in schizophrenia. To unravel the
      functional networks related to this left anterior insula region, we here combined
      resting state connectivity, meta-analytic-connectivity modeling (MACM) and
      structural covariance (SC) in addition to functional characterization based on
      BrainMap meta-data. Apart from allowing new insight into the seed region, this
      approach moreover provided an opportunity to systematically compare these
      different connectivity approaches. The results showed that the left anterior
      insula has a broad response profile and is part of multiple functional networks
      including language, memory and socio-emotional networks. As all these domains are
      linked with several symptoms of schizophrenia, dysfunction of the left anterior
      insula might be a crucial component contributing to this disorder. Moreover,
      although converging connectivity across all three connectivity approaches for the
      left anterior insula were found, also striking differences were observed. RS and 
      MACM as functional connectivity approaches specifically revealed functional
      networks linked with internal cognition and active perceptual/language processes,
      respectively. SC, in turn, showed a clear preference for highlighting regions
      involved in social cognition. These differential connectivity results thus
      indicate that the use of multiple forms of connectivity is advantageous when
      investigating functional networks as conceptual differences between these
      approaches might lead to systematic variation in the revealed functional
      networks.

TI  - The impact of MIR137 on dorsolateral prefrontal-hippocampal functional
      connectivity in healthy subjects.
PG  - 2153-60
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.63 [doi]
AB  - A recent mega-analysis combining genome-wide association study data revealed that
      a variant of microRNA 137 (MIR137) exhibits the most significant association with
      schizophrenia. Other biological evidence also consistently suggests that MIR137
      may have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the
      underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. As the disrupted dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) coupling with the hippocampal formation (HF) has been
      widely observed in schizophrenia patients, DLPFC-HF dysconnectivity can therefore
      be thought of as a pivotal intermediate phenotype that links genetic variants of 
      psychiatric risk genes to schizophrenia. This study used resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging to test whether the MIR137 variant (rs1625579) impacts
      DLPFC-HF functional connectivity and cognitive performance in 290 young, healthy 
      Han Chinese individuals. To identify functional connectivity between DLPFC and
      HF, a seed-based functional connectivity analysis was used. The association
      between DLPFC-HF connectivity and working memory performance was further examined
      in individuals with different MIR137 genotypes. The individuals who are
      homozygous for the MIR137 risk allele (TT), which confers a high risk for
      schizophrenia, exhibited significantly different DLPFC-HF functional connectivity
      compared with TG individuals. Moreover, the DLPFC-HF connectivity could predict
      the working memory performance in MIR137 TG individuals, but not in TT
      individuals. The current findings obtained in a large sample of healthy
      participants identified potential neural mechanisms linking MIR137 with the risk 
      of developing schizophrenia via the intermediate phenotype of DLPFC-HF
      connectivity.

TI  - Abnormal effective connectivity and psychopathological symptoms in the psychosis 
      high-risk state.
PG  - 239-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has revealed abnormal functional connectivity between
      the frontal and parietal brain regions during working memory processing in
      patients with schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis. However, it still
      remains unclear whether abnormal frontoparietal connectivity during working
      memory processing is already evident in the psychosis high-risk state and whether
      the connection strengths are related to psychopathological outcomes. METHODS:
      Healthy controls and antipsychotic-naive individuals with an at-risk mental state
      (ARMS) performed an n-back working memory task while undergoing functional
      magnetic resonance imaging. Effective connectivity between frontal and parietal
      brain regions during working memory processing were characterized using dynamic
      causal modelling. RESULTS: Our study included 19 controls and 27 individuals with
      an ARMS. In individuals with an ARMS, we found significantly lower task
      performances and reduced activity in the right superior parietal lobule and
      middle frontal gyrus than in controls. Furthermore, the working memory-induced
      modulation of the connectivity from the right middle frontal gyrus to the right
      superior parietal lobule was significantly reduced in individuals with an ARMS,
      while the extent of this connectivity was negatively related to the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale total score. LIMITATIONS: The modest sample size
      precludes a meaningful subgroup analysis for participants with a later transition
      to psychosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that abnormal frontoparietal
      connectivity during working memory processing is already evident in individuals
      with an ARMS and is related to psychiatric symptoms. Thus, our results provide
      further insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the psychosis high-risk
      state by linking functional brain imaging, computational modelling and
      psychopathology.

AB  - This proof-of-concept study examines the feasibility of defining subgroups in
      psychiatric spectrum disorders by generative embedding, using dynamical system
      models which infer neuronal circuit mechanisms from neuroimaging data. To this
      end, we re-analysed an fMRI dataset of 41 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia
      and 42 healthy controls performing a numerical n-back working-memory task. In our
      generative-embedding approach, we used parameter estimates from a dynamic causal 
      model (DCM) of a visual-parietal-prefrontal network to define a model-based
      feature space for the subsequent application of supervised and unsupervised
      learning techniques. First, using a linear support vector machine for
      classification, we were able to predict individual diagnostic labels
      significantly more accurately (78%) from DCM-based effective connectivity
      estimates than from functional connectivity between (62%) or local activity
      within the same regions (55%). Second, an unsupervised approach based on
      variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture modelling provided evidence for two
      clusters which mapped onto patients and controls with nearly the same accuracy
      (71%) as the supervised approach. Finally, when restricting the analysis only to 
      the patients, Gaussian mixture modelling suggested the existence of three patient
      subgroups, each of which was characterised by a different architecture of the
      visual-parietal-prefrontal working-memory network. Critically, even though this
      analysis did not have access to information about the patients' clinical
      symptoms, the three neurophysiologically defined subgroups mapped onto three
      clinically distinct subgroups, distinguished by significant differences in
      negative symptom severity, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale (PANSS). In summary, this study provides a concrete example of how
      psychiatric spectrum diseases may be split into subgroups that are defined in
      terms of neurophysiological mechanisms specified by a generative model of network
      dynamics such as DCM. The results corroborate our previous findings in stroke
      patients that generative embedding, compared to analyses of more conventional
      measures such as functional connectivity or regional activity, can significantly 
      enhance both the interpretability and performance of computational approaches to 
      clinical classification.

AB  - Working memory (WM) deficits and associated brain dysfunction are among the most 
      well replicated candidate endophenotypic processes in schizophrenia. However,
      previous studies demonstrate inconsistent over- and under-activation of
      dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC; VLPFC), inferior
      parietal lobule (IPL) during WM performance, as well as subcortical structures
      including the striatum, and dysfunctional connectivity among fronto-striatal
      regions in schizophrenia. However, no previous study has investigated
      task-related functional connectivity (FC) of DLPFC and striatal regions using a
      seed-based method; here we employed this method to assess patterns of cortical
      and subcortical functional connectivity among WM structures during a standard
      2-back WM task performed by 28 schizophrenia (SZ) and 28 healthy controls (HC).
      Initial group comparisons of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses
      during the WM task revealed significantly greater bilateral activity in the
      striatum in SZ relative to HC, but there was no significant group difference in
      WM cortical activity (right DLPFC, VLPFC or IPL). Analyses of FC within the
      cortico-subcortical WM network in the HC group revealed positive
      performance-related FC between the right DLPFC and the right caudate, and between
      the right VLPFC and the right IPL; this pattern was absent in SZ. In contrast, SZ
      patients showed negative performance-related functional connectivity between the 
      left putamen and the right VLPFC. Direct group comparisons in functional
      connectivity showed significantly greater performance-related FC between the
      VLPFC and bilateral putamen, as well as unilaterally between the VLPFC and the
      right IPL, in HC. Results suggest a critical dysfunction of cortico-striatal
      connectivity underpinning information retrieval for SZ patients during WM
      performance.

AB  - Although working memory is known to be impaired in schizophrenia the anatomical
      and functional relationships underlying this deficit remain to be elucidated. A
      combined imaging approach involving functional and structural magnetic resonance 
      techniques was used, applying independent component analysis and surface-based
      morphometry to 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls.
      Neurocognitive functioning was assessed by a neuropsychological test battery that
      measured executive function. It was hypothesized that working memory
      dysfunctional connectivity in schizophrenia is related to underlying anatomical
      abnormalities. Patients with schizophrenia showed cortical thinning in the left
      inferior frontal gyrus and insula, which explained 57% of blood oxygenation
      level-dependent signal magnitude in functional magnetic resonance imaging in the 
      central executive network (lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex)
      over-activation and default mode network (anterior and posterior cingulate)
      deactivation. No structure-function relationship emerged in the healthy control
      group. The study provides evidence to suggest that dysfunctional
      activation/deactivation patterns in schizophrenia may be explained in terms of
      underlying gray matter deficits.

AB  - Preclinical research suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors
      (NMDA-Rs) have a crucial role in working memory (WM). In this study, we
      investigated the role of NMDA-Rs in the brain activation and connectivity that
      subserve WM. Because of its importance in WM, the lateral prefrontal cortex,
      particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its connections, were the
      focus of analyses. Healthy participants (n=22) participated in a single
      functional magnetic resonance imaging session. They received saline and then the 
      NMDA-R antagonist ketamine while performing a spatial WM task. Time-course
      analysis was used to compare lateral prefrontal activation during saline and
      ketamine administration. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was used to 
      compare dorsolateral prefrontal connectivity during the two conditions and
      global-based connectivity was used to test for laterality in these effects.
      Ketamine reduced accuracy on the spatial WM task and brain activation during the 
      encoding and early maintenance (EEM) period of task trials. Decrements in
      task-related activation during EEM were related to performance deficits. Ketamine
      reduced connectivity in the DPFC network bilaterally, and region-specific
      reductions in connectivity were related to performance. These results support the
      hypothesis that NMDA-Rs are critical for WM. The knowledge gained may be helpful 
      in understanding disorders that might involve glutamatergic deficits such as
      schizophrenia and developing better treatments.

      at risk for schizophrenia may show subtle deficits in attention and working
      memory. In this study, we investigated the relationship between integrity of
      functional brain networks and performance in attention and working memory tasks
      as well as schizophrenia risk. METHODS: A total of 235 adults representing 3
      levels of risk (102 outpatients with schizophrenia, 70 unaffected first-degree
      relatives of persons with schizophrenia, and 63 unrelated healthy controls [HCs])
      completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and a battery of
      attention and working memory tasks (Brief Test of Attention, Hopkins Verbal
      Learning Test, and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test) on the same day. Functional
      networks were defined based on coupling with seeds in the dorsal anterior
      cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal
      cortex (MPFC), and primary visual cortex. Networks were then dissected into
      regional clusters of connectivity that were used to generate individual
      interaction matrices representing functional connectivity within each network.
      RESULTS: Both patients with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives showed
      cognitive dysfunction compared with HCs. First canonicals indicated an inverse
      relationship between cognitive performance and connectivity within the DLPFC and 
      MPFC networks. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed multivariate main
      effects of higher schizophrenia risk status on increased connectivity within the 
      DLPFC and MPFC networks. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that excessive
      connectivity within brain networks coupled to the DLPFC and MPFC, respectively,
      accompany cognitive deficits in persons at risk for schizophrenia. This might
      reflect compensatory reactions in neural systems required for cognitive
      processing of attention and working memory tasks to brain changes associated with
      schizophrenia.

AB  - This study examined the reproducibility of prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity
      estimates obtained by stochastic dynamic causal modeling (sDCM). 180 healthy
      subjects were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a
      standard working memory N-Back task at three different sites (Mannheim, Bonn,
      Berlin; each with 60 participants). The reproducibility of regional activations
      in key regions for working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC;
      hippocampal formation, HF) was evaluated using conjunction analyses across
      locations. These analyses showed consistent activation of right DLPFC and
      deactivation of left HF across all three different sites. The effective
      connectivity between DLPFC and HF was analyzed using a simple two-region sDCM.
      For each subject, we evaluated sixty-seven alternative sDCMs and compared their
      relative plausibility using Bayesian model selection (BMS). Across all locations,
      BMS consistently revealed the same winning model, with the 2-Back working memory 
      condition as driving input to both DLPFC and HF and with a connection from DLPFC 
      to HF. Statistical tests on the sDCM parameter estimates did not show any
      significant differences across the three sites. The consistency of both the BMS
      results and model parameter estimates indicates the reliability of sDCM in our
      paradigm. This provides a basis for future genetic and clinical studies using
      this approach.

AB  - Executive dysfunction is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Functional
      neuro-imaging studies have suggested an association between deficits in
      activating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and executive dysfunction, 
      but neuro-integration from the DLPFC to the whole brain remains unclear. Studies 
      investigating the neuro-integration from the DLPFC to the whole brain in
      unaffected but genetically liable family members are scant. In this study, we
      report DLPFC neuro-integrative deficits correlated with executive dysfunction and
      family history of schizophrenia using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). Using seed regions in DLPFC, we examined resting-state functional
      connectivity in 25 patients with schizophrenia, 25 unaffected first-degree
      relatives (UR), and 25 healthy control (HC) persons. Schizophrenia patients and
      UR have impaired connectivity from DLPFC to its coordinated regions (ANOVA:
      F=7.316-10.974, p<0.001). These coordinated brain regions are distributed in the 
      bilateral caudate, left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and
      right cerebellum. The individual functional connectivity strength between the
      left DLPFC and its coordinated regions was correlated with individual executive
      function performance among whole persons. (Pearson's r=0.244-0.366,
      p=0.035-0.008) Our findings support that distributed neuro-integrative DLPFC
      deficits reflect a genetic risk for schizophrenia and that these deficits are
      present, to a lesser degree, in unaffected first-degree relatives. Our findings
      also support that neuro-integration might correlate with a patient's executive
      function performance.

AB  - Neural plasticity is crucial for understanding the experience-dependent
      reorganization of brain regulatory circuits and the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. An important circuit-level feature derived from functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is prefrontal-hippocampal seeded connectivity
      during working memory, the best established intermediate connectivity phenotype
      of schizophrenia risk to date. The phenotype is a promising marker for the
      effects of plasticity-enhancing interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and can be studied in healthy
      volunteers in the absence of illness-related confounds, but the relationship to
      brain plasticity is unexplored. We recruited 39 healthy volunteers to investigate
      the effects of 5 Hz rTMS on prefrontal-hippocampal coupling during working memory
      and rest. In a randomized and sham-controlled experiment, neuronavigation-guided 
      rTMS was applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and fMRI
      and functional connectivity analyses [seeded connectivity and psychophysiological
      interaction (PPI)] were used as readouts. Moreover, the test-retest reliability
      of working-memory related connectivity markers was evaluated. rTMS provoked a
      significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the right DLPFC and
      left hippocampus during working memory that proved to be relatively
      time-invariant and robust. PPI analyses provided evidence for a nominal effect of
      rTMS and poor test-retest reliability. No effects on n-back-related activation
      and DLPFC-hippocampus resting-state connectivity were observed. These data
      provide the first in vivo evidence for the effects of plasticity induction on
      human prefrontal-hippocampal network dynamics, offer insights into the biological
      mechanisms of a well established intermediate phenotype linked to schizophrenia, 
      and underscores the importance of the choice of outcome measures in test-retest
      designs.

TI  - Association of rs1006737 in CACNA1C with alterations in prefrontal activation and
      fronto-hippocampal connectivity.
PG  - 1190-200
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22244 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified the rs1006737 single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CACNA1C gene as a susceptibility locus for
      schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. On the neural systems level this association 
      is explained by altered functioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      and the hippocampal formation (HF), brain regions also affected by mental
      illness. In the present study we investigated the association of rs1006737
      genotype with prefrontal activation and fronto-hippocampal connectivity. METHODS:
      We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activation during
      an n-back working memory task in 94 healthy subjects. All subjects were genotyped
      for the SNP rs1006737. We tested associations of the rs1006737 genotype with
      changes in working-memory-related DLPFC activation and functional integration
      using a seed region functional connectivity approach. RESULTS: Rs1006737 genotype
      was associated with altered right-hemispheric DLPFC activation. The homozygous A 
      (risk) group showed decreased activation compared to G-allele carriers. Further, 
      the functional connectivity analysis revealed a positive association of
      fronto-hippocampal connectivity with rs1006737 A alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We did not
      replicate the previous findings of increased right DLPFC activation in CACNA1C
      rs1006737 A homozygotes. In fact, we found the opposite effect, thus questioning 
      prefrontal inefficiency as rs1006737 genotype-related intermediate phenotype. On 
      the other hand, our results indicate that alterations in the functional coupling 
      between the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe could represent a
      neural system phenotype that is mediated by CACNA1C rs1006737 and other genetic
      susceptibility loci for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

PG  - 84-92
LID - 10.1159/000344001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia (SZ) has been suggested to
      influence the cortical systems supporting working memory (WM) and face
      processing. Genetic imaging studies link the SZ risk variant rs1344706 on the
      ZNF804A gene to psychosis via alterations in functional brain connectivity during
      WM, but no work has looked at the effects of ZNF804A on WM with face-processing
      components. METHODS: We therefore investigated healthy controls that were
      genotyped for rs1344706 with a face WM task during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging. We suggested that variation at the rs1344706 locus would be associated
      with similar alterations as patients previously tested using the same WM task for
      faces. RESULTS: The rs1344706 risk allele was indeed associated with altered
      activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal (rDLPFC) cortex. We established
      that the rDLPFC was activated in a task-dependent manner, suggesting that the
      differences in activation between rs1344706 genotype groups reflected alterations
      in task processing. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the rDLPFC region showed
      significant volumetric overlap with the rDLPFC which had previously been reported
      to be altered during task processing for patients with SZ. CONCLUSIONS: The
      findings support an association between rs1344706 and alterations in DLPFC
      activity during WM for faces. We further suggest that WM for faces may be a
      useful intermediate phenotype in the investigation of genetic susceptibility to
      psychosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The theory that prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction in schizophrenia 
      leads to excess subcortical dopamine has generated widespread interest because it
      provides a parsimonious account for two core features of schizophrenia, cognitive
      deficits and psychosis, respectively. However, there has been limited empirical
      validation of this model. Moreover, the identity of the specific subcortical
      brain regions and circuits that may be impaired as a result of PFC dysfunction
      and mediate its link to psychosis in schizophrenia remains unclear. We undertook 
      this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study to test the
      hypothesis that PFC dysfunction is associated with altered function of and
      connectivity with dopamine regulating regions of the basal ganglia. METHODS:
      Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19
      healthy control participants completed event-related functional magnetic
      resonance imaging during working memory. We conducted between-group contrasts of 
      task-evoked, univariate activation maps to identify regions of altered function
      in schizophrenia. We also compared the groups on the level of functional
      connectivity between a priori identified PFC and basal ganglia regions to
      determine if prefrontal disconnectivity in patients was present. RESULTS: We
      observed task-evoked hyperactivity of the substantia nigra that occurred in
      association with prefrontal and striatal hypoactivity in the schizophrenia group.
      The magnitude of prefrontal functional connectivity with these dysfunctional
      basal ganglia regions was decreased in the schizophrenia group. Additionally, the
      level of nigrostriatal functional connectivity predicted the level of psychosis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that functional impairments of the prefrontal 
      striatonigral circuit may be a common pathway linking the pathogenesis of
      cognitive deficits and psychosis in schizophrenia.

AB  - Since working memory deficits in schizophrenia have been linked to negative
      symptoms, we tested whether features of the one could predict the treatment
      outcome in the other. Specifically, we hypothesized that working memory-related
      functional connectivity at pre-treatment can predict improvement of negative
      symptoms in antipsychotic-treated patients. Fourteen antipsychotic-naive patients
      with first-episode schizophrenia were clinically assessed before and after 7
      months of quetiapine monotherapy. At baseline, patients underwent functional
      magnetic resonance imaging while performing a verbal n-back task. Spatial
      independent component analysis identified task-modulated brain networks. A linear
      support vector machine was trained with these components to discriminate six
      patients who showed improvement in negative symptoms from eight non-improvers.
      Classification accuracy and significance was estimated by leave-one-out
      cross-validation and permutation tests, respectively. Two frontoparietal and one 
      default mode network components predicted negative symptom improvement with a
      classification accuracy of 79% (p = 0.003). Discriminating features were found in
      the frontoparietal networks but not the default mode network. These preliminary
      data suggest that functional patterns at baseline can predict negative symptom
      treatment-response in schizophrenia. This information may be used to stratify
      patients into subgroups thereby facilitating personalized treatment.

AB  - Anomalous activations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior cerebral areas
      have been reported in previous studies of working memory in schizophrenia.
      Several interpretations have been reported: e.g., neural inefficiency, the use of
      different strategies and differences in the functional organization of the
      cerebral cortex. To better understand these abnormal activations, we investigated
      the cerebral bases of a working memory component process, namely refreshing
      (i.e., thinking briefly of a just-activated representation). Fifteen patients
      with schizophrenia and 15 control subjects participated in this functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Participants were told that whenever
      they saw a word on the screen, they had to read it silently to themselves (read
      and repeat conditions), and when they saw a dot, they had to think of the
      just-previous word (refresh condition). The refresh condition (in comparison with
      the read condition) was associated with significantly increased activation in the
      left inferior frontal gyrus and significantly decreased connectivity within the
      prefrontal cortex and between the prefrontal and parietal cortices in patients
      with schizophrenia in comparison with control subjects. These results suggest
      that prefrontal dysfunctions in schizophrenia might be related to a defective
      ability to initiate (rather than to execute) specific cognitive processes.

AB  - Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
      is vital for the cortical computations underlying cognition and might be
      disrupted in severe neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Studies on 
      this topic have been limited to processes in local circuits; however, cognition
      involves large-scale brain systems with multiple interacting regions. A prominent
      feature of the human brain's global architecture is the anticorrelation of
      default-mode vs. task-positive systems. Here, we show that administration of an
      NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, disrupted the reciprocal
      relationship between these systems in terms of task-dependent activation and
      connectivity during performance of delayed working memory. Furthermore, the
      degree of this disruption predicted task performance and transiently evoked
      symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia. We offer a parsimonious hypothesis for 
      this disruption via biophysically realistic computational modeling, namely
      cortical disinhibition. Together, the present findings establish links between
      glutamate's role in the organization of large-scale anticorrelated neural
      systems, cognition, and symptoms associated with schizophrenia in humans.

AB  - Neuronal plasticity is crucial for flexible interaction with a changing
      environment and its disruption is thought to contribute to psychiatric diseases
      like schizophrenia. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) is a noninvasive tool to increase local excitability of neurons and induce
      short-time functional reorganization of cortical networks. While this has been
      shown for the motor system, little is known about the short-term plasticity of
      networks for executive cognition in humans. We examined 12 healthy control
      subjects in a crossover study with fMRI after real and sham 5 Hz rTMS to the
      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). During scanning, subjects performed
      an n-back working memory (WM) task and a flanker task engaging cognitive control.
      Reaction times during the n-back task were significantly shorter after rTMS than 
      after sham stimulation. RTMS compared with sham stimulation caused no activation 
      changes at the stimulation site (right DLPFC) itself, but significantly increased
      connectivity within the WM network during n-back and reduced activation in the
      anterior cingulate cortex during the flanker task. Reduced reaction times after
      real stimulation support an excitatory effect of high-frequency rTMS. Our
      findings identified plastic changes in prefrontally connected networks downstream
      of the stimulation site as the substrate of this behavioral effect. Using a
      multimodal fMRI-rTMS approach, we could demonstrate changes in cortical
      plasticity in humans during executive cognition. In further studies this approach
      could be used to study pharmacological, genetic and disease-related alterations.

      an integral feature of schizophrenia. The WM network, and the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in particular, undergo significant remodeling in late
      adolescence. Potential interactions between developmental changes in the WM
      network and disease-related processes for schizophrenia remain unclear. The aim
      of this study was to determine whether DLPFC activation and functional
      connectivity are impaired during WM in patients with early-onset schizophrenia
      (EOS; age of onset <18 years). METHOD: We used functional magnetic resonance
      imaging and psychophysiological interaction analysis to respectively measure
      blood oxygenation level-dependent signal and to derive functional connectivity
      estimates in response to the two-back WM task from 25 youths with EOS and 20
      matched healthy adolescents. RESULTS: Compared with healthy adolescents, patients
      with EOS showed reduced engagement of the DLPFC, the anterior cingulate cortex
      (ACC), and frontal operculum, and had reduced DLPFC connectivity within the WM
      network. Patients with EOS showed abnormal reduction in the coupling of the DLPFC
      with the ACC, the inferior parietal lobule, and the middle occipital gyrus. In
      contrast to healthy adolescents, patients with EOS expressed age-related decrease
      in the activity of the DLPFC and an increase in its connectivity with the ACC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with EOS show dysfunctional engagement and reduced
      integration within the WM neural network. The pattern of abnormal age-related
      correlations in DLPFC activity and connectivity suggests that
      schizophrenia-related processes have an impact on brain regions that show
      significant late developmental changes.

AB  - In recent years, one of the most important findings in systems neuroscience has
      been the identification of large scale distributed brain networks. These networks
      support healthy brain function and are perturbed in a number of neurological
      disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). Their study is therefore an important and
      evolving focus for neuroscience research. The majority of network studies are
      conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which relies on
      changes in blood oxygenation induced by neural activity. However recently, a
      small number of studies have begun to elucidate the electrical origin of fMRI
      networks by searching for correlations between neural oscillatory signals from
      spatially separate brain areas in magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Here we
      advance this research area. We introduce two methodological extensions to
      previous independent component analysis (ICA) approaches to MEG network
      characterisation: 1) we show how to derive pan-spectral networks that combine
      independent components computed within individual frequency bands. 2) We show how
      to measure the temporal evolution of each network with millisecond temporal
      resolution. We apply our approach to ~10h of MEG data recorded in 28 experimental
      sessions during 3 separate cognitive tasks showing that a number of networks
      could be identified and were robust across time, task, subject and recording
      session. Further, we show that neural oscillations in those networks are
      modulated by memory load, and task relevance. This study furthers recent findings
      on electrodynamic brain networks and paves the way for future clinical studies in
      patients in which abnormal connectivity is thought to underlie core symptoms.

      schizophrenia during working memory interference.
PG  - 8-14
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2012.07.007 [doi]
AB  - Characterizing working memory (WM) abnormalities represents a fundamental
      challenge in schizophrenia research given the impact of cognitive deficits on
      life outcome in patients. In prior work we demonstrated that dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation was related to successful distracter
      resistance during WM in healthy controls, but not in schizophrenia. Although
      understanding the impact of regional functional deficits is critical, functional 
      connectivity abnormalities among nodes within WM networks may constitute a final 
      common pathway for WM impairment. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis
      that schizophrenia is associated with functional connectivity abnormalities
      within DLPFC networks during distraction conditions in WM. 28 patients and 24
      controls completed a delayed non-verbal WM task that included transient visual
      distraction during the WM maintenance phase. We computed DLPFC whole-brain
      task-based functional connectivity (tb-fcMRI) specifically during the maintenance
      phase in the presence or absence of distraction. Results revealed that patients
      failed to modulate tb-fcMRI during distracter presentation in both cortical and
      sub-cortical regions. Specifically, controls demonstrated reductions in tb-fcMRI 
      between DLPFC and the extended amygdala when distraction was present. Conversely,
      patients failed to demonstrate a change in coupling with the amygdala, but showed
      greater connectivity with medio-dorsal thalamus. While controls showed more
      positive coupling between DLPFC and other prefrontal cortical regions during
      distracter presentation, patients failed to exhibit such a modulation. Taken
      together, these findings support the notion that observed distracter resistance
      deficit involves a breakdown in coupling between DLPFC and distributed regions,
      encompassing both subcortical (thalamic/limbic) and control region connectivity.

      memory performance.
PG  - e38195
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0038195 [doi]
AB  - Impairment of working memory (WM) performance in schizophrenia patients (SZ) is
      well-established. Compared to healthy controls (HC), SZ patients show aberrant
      blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activations and disrupted functional
      connectivity during WM performance. In this study, we examined the small-world
      network metrics computed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
      collected as 35 HC and 35 SZ performed a Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm
      (SIRP) at three WM load levels. Functional connectivity networks were built by
      calculating the partial correlation on preprocessed time courses of BOLD signal
      between task-related brain regions of interest (ROIs) defined by group
      independent component analysis (ICA). The networks were then thresholded within
      the small-world regime, resulting in undirected binarized small-world networks at
      different working memory loads. Our results showed: 1) at the medium WM load
      level, the networks in SZ showed a lower clustering coefficient and less local
      efficiency compared with HC; 2) in SZ, most network measures altered
      significantly as the WM load level increased from low to medium and from medium
      to high, while the network metrics were relatively stable in HC at different WM
      loads; and 3) the altered structure at medium WM load in SZ was related to their 
      performance during the task, with longer reaction time related to lower
      clustering coefficient and lower local efficiency. These findings suggest brain
      connectivity in patients with SZ was more diffuse and less strongly linked
      locally in functional network at intermediate level of WM when compared to HC. SZ
      show distinctly inefficient and variable network structures in response to WM
      load increase, comparing to stable highly clustered network topologies in HC.

PG  - 1436-45

AB  - Working memory is a limited capacity system that integrates and manipulates
      information across brief periods of time, engaging a network of prefrontal,
      parietal and subcortical brain regions. Genetic control of these heritable brain 
      processes have been suggested by functional genetic variations influencing
      dopamine signalling, which affect prefrontal activity during complex working
      memory tasks. However, less is known about genetic control over component working
      memory cortical-subcortical networks in humans, and the pharmacogenetic
      implications of dopamine-related genes on cognition in patients receiving
      anti-dopaminergic drugs. Here, we examined predictions from basic models of
      dopaminergic signalling in cortical and cortical-subcortical circuitries
      implicated in dissociable working memory maintenance and manipulation processes. 
      We also examined pharmacogenetic effects on cognition in the context of
      anti-dopaminergic drug therapy. Using dynamic causal models of functional
      magnetic resonance imaging in normal subjects (n = 46), we identified
      differentiated effects of functional polymorphisms in COMT, DRD2 and AKT1 genes
      on prefrontal-parietal and prefrontal-striatal circuits engaged during
      maintenance and manipulation, respectively. Cortical synaptic dopamine monitored 
      by the COMT Val158Met polymorphism influenced prefrontal control of both parietal
      processing in working memory maintenance and striatal processing in working
      memory manipulation. DRD2 and AKT1 polymorphisms implicated in DRD2 signalling
      influenced only the prefrontal-striatal network associated with manipulation. In 
      the context of anti-psychotic drugs, the DRD2 and AKT1 polymorphisms altered
      dose-response effects of anti-psychotic drugs on cognition in schizophrenia (n = 
      111). Thus, we suggest that genetic modulation of DRD2-AKT1-related
      prefrontal-subcortical circuits could at least in part influence cognitive
      dysfunction in psychosis and its treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysconnectivity between brain regions is thought to underlie the
      cognitive abnormalities that characterise schizophrenia (SZ). Consistent with
      this notion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) studies in SZ have reliably provided evidence of abnormalities in
      functional integration and in white matter connectivity. Yet little is known
      about how alterations at the functional level related to abnormalities in
      anatomical connectivity. METHODS: We obtained fMRI data during the 2-back working
      memory task from 25 patients with SZ and 19 healthy controls matched for age, sex
      and IQ. DTI data were also acquired in the same session. In addition to
      conventional unimodal analyses we extracted "features" [contrast maps for fMRI
      and fractional anisotropy (FA) for DTI] that were subjected to joint independent 
      component analysis (JICA) in order to examine interactions between fMRI and DTI
      data sources. RESULTS: Conventional unimodal analyses revealed both functional
      and structural deficits in patients with SZ. The JICA identified regions of
      joint, multimodal brain sources that differed in patients and controls. The fMRI 
      source implicated regions within the anterior cingulate and ventrolateral
      prefrontal cortex and in the cuneus where patients showed relative hypoactivation
      and within the frontopolar cortex where patients showed relative hyperactivation.
      The DTI source localised reduced FA in patients in the splenium and posterior
      cingulum. CONCLUSIONS: This study promotes our understanding of
      structure-function relationships in SZ by characterising linked functional and
      white matter changes that contribute to working memory dysfunction in this
      disorder.

AB  - Phenomenological models of decision-making, including the drift-diffusion and
      race models, are compared with mechanistic, biologically plausible models, such
      as integrate-and-fire attractor neuronal network models. The attractor network
      models show how decision confidence is an emergent property; and make testable
      predictions about the neural processes (including neuronal activity and fMRI
      signals) involved in decision-making which indicate that the medial prefrontal
      cortex is involved in reward value-based decision-making. Synaptic facilitation
      in these models can help to account for sequential vibrotactile decision-making, 
      and for how postponed decision-related responses are made. The randomness in the 
      neuronal spiking-related noise that makes the decision-making probabilistic is
      shown to be increased by the graded firing rate representations found in the
      brain, to be decreased by the diluted connectivity, and still to be significant
      in biologically large networks with thousands of synapses onto each neuron. The
      stability of these systems is shown to be influenced in different ways by
      glutamatergic and GABAergic efficacy, leading to a new field of dynamical
      neuropsychiatry with applications to understanding schizophrenia and
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. The noise in these systems is shown to be
      advantageous, and to apply to similar attractor networks involved in short-term
      memory, long-term memory, attention, and associative thought processes.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with abnormal function of the default
      mode network (DMN), a distributed network of brain regions more active during
      rest than during performance of many attention-demanding tasks and characterized 
      by a high degree of functional connectivity (i.e., temporal correlations between 
      brain regions). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed that 
      the DMN in the healthy brain is associated with stimulus-independent thought and 
      self-reflection and that greater suppression of the DMN is associated with better
      performance on attention-demanding tasks. In schizophrenia and depression, the
      DMN is often found to be hyperactivated and hyperconnected. In schizophrenia this
      may relate to overly intensive self-reference and impairments in attention and
      working memory. In depression, DMN hyperactivity may be related to negative
      rumination. These findings are considered in terms of what is known about
      psychological functions supported by the DMN, and alteration of the DMN in other 
      neuropsychiatric disorders.

      schizophrenia.

AB  - The neural mechanisms behind cognitive deficits in schizophrenia still remain
      unclear. Functional neuroimaging studies on working memory (WM) yielded
      inconsistent results, suggesting task performance as a moderating variable of
      prefrontal activation. Beyond regional specific activation, disordered
      integration of brain regions was supposed as a critical pathophysiological
      mechanism of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Here, we first hypothesized
      that prefrontal activation implicated in WM depends primarily on task performance
      and therefore stratified participants into performance subgroups. Second, in line
      with the dysconnectivity hypothesis, we asked whether connectivity in the
      prefrontal-parietal network underlying WM is altered in all patients. We used
      functional magnetic resonance imaging in human subjects (41 schizophrenia
      patients, 42 healthy controls) and dynamic causal modeling to examine effective
      connectivity during a WM task. In line with our first hypothesis, we found that
      prefrontal activation was differentially modulated by task performance: there was
      a significant task by group by performance interaction revealing an increase of
      activation with performance in patients and a decrease with performance in
      controls. Beyond that, we show for the first time that WM-dependent effective
      connectivity from prefrontal to parietal cortex is reduced in all schizophrenia
      patients. This finding was independent of performance. In conclusion, our results
      are in line with the highly influential hypothesis that the relationship between 
      WM performance and prefrontal activation follows an inverted U-shaped function.
      Moreover, this study in a large sample of patients reveals a mechanism underlying
      prefrontal inefficiency and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, thereby
      providing direct experimental evidence for the dysconnectivity hypothesis.

LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.10.025 [doi]
AB  - We present a statistical and graphical visualization MATLAB toolbox for the
      analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, called the
      Bayesian Spatial Model for activation and connectivity (BSMac). BSMac
      simultaneously performs whole-brain activation analyses at the voxel and region
      of interest (ROI) levels as well as task-related functional connectivity (FC)
      analyses using a flexible Bayesian modeling framework (Bowman et al., 2008).
      BSMac allows for inputting data in either Analyze or Nifti file formats. The user
      provides information pertaining to subgroup memberships, scanning sessions, and
      experimental tasks (stimuli), from which the design matrix is constructed. BSMac 
      then performs parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
      methods and generates plots for activation and FC, such as interactive 2D maps of
      voxel and region-level task-related changes in neural activity and animated 3D
      graphics of the FC results. The toolbox can be downloaded from
      http://www.sph.emory.edu/bios/CBIS/. We illustrate the BSMac toolbox through an
      application to an fMRI study of working memory in patients with schizophrenia.

      connectivity.
PG  - 304-13
LID - 10.1002/hbm.21434 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies identified the single nucleotide polymorphism
      rs1344706 in ZNF804A as a common risk-variant for schizophrenia and bipolar
      disorder. Whereas the molecular function of ZNF804A is yet unclear, recent
      imaging genetics studies have started to characterize the neural systems
      architecture linking rs1344706 genotype to psychosis. Carring rs1344706
      risk-alleles was associated with a decrease in functional connectivity within the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs) as well as an increase in connectivity 
      between the DLPFC and the hippocampal formation (HF) in the context of a working 
      memory task. The present study aimed at replicating these findings in an
      independent sample of 94 healthy subjects. Subjects were genotyped for rs1344706 
      and performed a working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
      Results indicate no support for a decrease of functional coupling between the
      bilateral DLPFCs at higher ZNF804A risk status. However, the current data show
      the previously described alteration in functional coupling between the right
      DLPFC and the HFs, albeit with weaker effects. Decoupled by default, the
      functional connectivity between the right DLPFC and anterior HFs increased with
      the number of rs1344706 risk alleles. The present data support fronto-hippocampal
      dysconnectivity as intermediate phenotype linking rs1344706 genotype to
      psychosis. We discuss the issues in replicating the interhemispheric DLPFC
      coupling in light of the effect sizes rs1344706 genotype has on brain function,
      concluding that further independent replication studies are fundamentally needed 
      to ascertain the role of rs1344706 in the functional integration of neural
      systems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine measures of anatomical connectivity
      between the thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in schizophrenia and to
      assess their functional implications. We measured thalamocortical connectivity
      with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography in 15 patients
      with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched controls. The relationship between
      thalamocortical connectivity and prefrontal cortical
      blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional activity as well as
      behavioral performance during working memory was examined in a subsample of 9
      patients and 18 controls. Compared with controls, schizophrenia patients showed
      reduced total connectivity of the thalamus to only one of six cortical regions,
      the LPFC. The size of the thalamic region with at least 25% of model fibers
      reaching the LPFC was also reduced in patients compared with controls. The total 
      thalamocortical connectivity to the LPFC predicted working memory task
      performance and also correlated with LPFC BOLD activation. Notably, the
      correlation with BOLD activation was accentuated in patients as compared with
      controls in the ventral LPFC. These results suggest that thalamocortical
      connectivity to the LPFC is altered in schizophrenia with functional consequences
      on working memory processing in LPFC.

TI  - Cortico-striatal disconnection within the cingulo-opercular network in
      schizophrenia revealed by intrinsic functional connectivity analysis: a resting
      fMRI study.
PG  - 238-47

AB  - The cingulo-opercular network (CON) is a newly defined control network
      responsible for various cognitive processes that have been consistently found to 
      be impaired in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to use functional
      connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to test the hypothesis that
      schizophrenia is associated with functional disconnection within the CON. Thirty 
      subjects with schizophrenia and thirty healthy controls were enrolled in the
      study. Each subject received resting fMRI scanning, clinical evaluations and
      cognitive examinations. The CON of each subject was derived by calculating the
      functional connectivity map of a seed in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). A 
      between-group comparison was performed using a random effect analysis. Further
      network analyses with multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were performed to
      characterize the pattern of functional disconnection within the entire CON. Using
      the dACC seed in healthy controls, we derived the CON, which includes the
      following anatomical structures: the dACC; the bilateral anterior prefrontal,
      inferior parietal and anterior insular cortices; the putamen; the thalamus; and
      the cerebellum. Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenic patients showed
      significantly reduced functional connectivity in the bilateral putamens. Further 
      network analysis demonstrated widespread cortico-striatal disconnection within
      the CON of schizophrenic patients. The disconnections correlated with negative
      symptom severity. Behavioral regression revealed that cortico-striatal functional
      connectivity predicted 2-back working memory performance in healthy controls, but
      not in schizophrenic patients. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia is
      associated with cortical-striatal disconnection within the CON. The result
      provides a network basis for the cortico-striatal disconnection hypothesis of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Altered cortical network dynamics: a potential intermediate phenotype for
      schizophrenia and association with ZNF804A.
PG  - 1207-17
LID - 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.103 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Studies have shown patterns of abnormal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) functional connectivity with other brain areas in schizophrenia and
      association of these patterns with a putative susceptibility gene (ZNF804A).
      However, whether these patterns are trait phenomena linked to genetic risk for
      illness is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that altered DLPFC
      connectivity is (1) a familial, likely heritable feature of genetic risk for
      schizophrenia, (2) a novel intermediate phenotype independent of altered DLPFC
      engagement, and (3) selectively modulated by a polymorphism in ZNF804A. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional case-control study using blood oxygen level-dependent functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory task and genotyping of
      rs1344706 in ZNF804A. SETTING: Research center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 402
      subjects (153 cognitively normal controls, 171 healthy siblings of patients with 
      schizophrenia, and 78 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Task-independent and
      task-dependent physiologic coupling between the DLPFC and other brain "target"
      regions investigated with (1) seeded connectivity and (2) psychophysiological
      interaction analysis. RESULTS: Siblings and patients showed greater DLPFC
      "inefficiency" than controls. Abnormal DLPFC functional coupling with the
      hippocampus and, to a lesser degree, the rest of the prefrontal cortex, was
      observed in patients and siblings when compared with controls using both
      connectivity analyses. Prefrontal activation and connectivity measures within
      siblings did not correlate, implying that they were independent phenomena. The
      ZNF804A genotype significantly modulated DLPFC coupling with the hippocampus and 
      prefrontal cortex but not DLPFC activity in the control group. Similarly, ZNF804A
      genotype modulated right DLPFC-hippocampal formation coupling in siblings and
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Coupling between the DLPFC and hippocampus is compromised 
      in siblings of patients with schizophrenia and is independent of DLPFC
      engagement. The selective association with a single-nucleotide polymorphism in
      ZNF804A suggests that this intermediate phenotype proxies a distinct neural
      system mechanism related to genetic risk for schizophrenia and the biology of
      this gene.

LID - 10.1017/S0033291711001073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether first-episode psychosis is characterized by
      the same prefrontal cortex functional imaging abnormalities as chronic
      schizophrenia. METHOD: Thirty patients with a first episode of non-affective
      functional psychosis and 28 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the n-back working memory task.
      Voxel-based analyses of brain activations and deactivations were carried out and 
      compared between groups. The connectivity of regions of significant difference
      between the patients and controls was also examined. RESULTS: The first-episode
      patients did not show significant prefrontal hypo- or hyperactivation compared to
      controls. However, they showed failure of deactivation in the medial frontal
      cortex. This area showed high levels of connectivity with the posterior cingulate
      gyrus/precuneus and parts of the parietal cortex bilaterally. Failure of
      deactivation was significantly greater in first-episode patients who had or went 
      on to acquire a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia than in those who did not, and 
      in those who met RDC criteria for schizophrenia compared to those who did not.
      CONCLUSIONS: First-episode psychosis is not characterized by hypo- or
      hyperfrontality but instead by a failure of deactivation in the medial frontal
      cortex. The location and connectivity of this area suggest that it is part of the
      default mode network. The failure of deactivation seems to be particularly marked
      in first-episode patients who have, or progress to, schizophrenia.

LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.06.009 [doi]
AB  - Although regional brain abnormalities underlying spatial working memory (SWM)
      deficits in schizophrenia have been identified, little is known about which brain
      circuits are functionally disrupted in the SWM network in schizophrenia. We
      investigated SWM-related interregional functional connectivity in schizophrenia
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during a memory
      task that required analysis of spatial information in object structure. Twelve
      schizophrenia patients and 11 normal control subjects participated. Patients had 
      SWM performance deficits and deficient neural activation in various brain areas, 
      especially in the high SWM load condition. Examination of the covariation of
      regional brain activations elicited by the SWM task revealed evidence of
      functional disconnection between prefrontal and posterior visual association
      areas in schizophrenia. Under low SMW load, we found reduced functional
      associations between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior temporal
      cortex (ITC) in the right hemisphere in patients. Under high SWM load, we found
      evidence for further functional disconnection in patients, including additional
      reduced functional associations between left DLPFC and right visual areas,
      including the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), fusiform gyrus, and V1, as well as
      between right inferior frontal cortex and right PPC. Greater prefrontal-posterior
      cortical functional connectivity was associated with better SWM performance in
      controls, but not in patients. These results suggest that prefrontal-posterior
      functional connectivity associated with the maintenance and control of visual
      information is central to SWM, and that disruption of this functional network
      underlies SWM deficits in schizophrenia.

PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.02.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fundamental challenge for understanding neuropsychiatric disease is
      identifying sources of individual differences in psychopathology, especially when
      there is substantial heterogeneity of symptom expression, such as is found in
      schizophrenia (SCZ). We hypothesized that such heterogeneity might arise in part 
      from consistently widespread yet variably patterned alterations in the
      connectivity of focal brain regions. METHODS: We used resting state functional
      connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to identify variable global
      dysconnectivity in 23 patients with DSM-IV SCZ relative to 22 age-, gender-, and 
      parental socioeconomic status-matched control subjects with a novel global brain 
      connectivity method that is robust to high variability across individuals. We
      examined cognitive functioning with a modified Sternberg task and subtests from
      the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. We measured symptom severity
      with the Scale for Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. RESULTS: We
      identified a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) region with global and highly
      variable dysconnectivity involving within-PFC underconnectivity and non-PFC
      overconnectivity in patients. Variability in this "under/over" pattern of
      dysconnectivity strongly predicted the severity of cognitive deficits (matrix
      reasoning IQ, verbal IQ, and working memory performance) as well as individual
      differences in every cardinal symptom domain of SCZ (poverty, reality distortion,
      and disorganization). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that global
      dysconnectivity underlies dorsolateral PFC involvement in the neuropathology of
      SCZ. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the possibility that specific
      patterns of dysconnectivity with a given network hub region might explain
      individual differences in symptom presentation in SCZ. Critically, such findings 
      might extend to other neuropathologies with diverse presentation.

TI  - Functional brain imaging in schizophrenia: selected results and methods.
PG  - 181-214
AB  - Functional brain imaging studies of patients with schizophrenia may be grouped
      into those that assume that the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are due to
      disordered circuitry within a critical brain region and studies that assume that 
      the signs and symptoms are due to disordered connections among brain regions.
      Studies have investigated the disordered functional brain anatomy of both the
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Studies of spontaneous
      hallucinations find that although hallucinations are associated with abnormal
      brain activity in primary and secondary sensory areas, disordered brain
      activation associated with hallucinations is not limited to sensory systems.
      Disordered activation in non-sensory regions appear to contribute to the
      emotional strength and valence of hallucinations, to be a factor underlying an
      inability to distinguish ongoing mental processing from memories, and to reflect 
      the brain's attempt to modulate the intensity of hallucinations and resolve
      conflicts with other processing demands. Brain activation studies support the
      view that auditory/verbal hallucinations are associated with an impaired ability 
      of internal speech plans to modulate neural activation in sensory language areas.
      In early studies, negative symptoms of schizophrenia were hypothesized to be
      associated with impaired function in frontal brain areas. In support of this
      hypothesis meta-analytical studies have found that resting blood flow or
      metabolism in frontal cortex is reduced in schizophrenia, though the magnitude of
      the effect is only small to moderate. Brain activation studies of working memory 
      (WM) functioning are typically associated with large effect sizes in the frontal 
      cortex, whereas studies of functions other than WM generally reveal smaller
      effects. Findings from some functional connectivity studies have supported the
      hypothesis that schizophrenia patients experience impaired functional connections
      between frontal and temporal cortex, although the nature of the disordered
      connectivity is complex. More recent studies have used functional brain imaging
      to study neural compensation in schizophrenia, to serve as endophenotypes in
      genetic studies and to provide biomarkers in drug development studies. These
      emerging trends in functional brain imaging research are likely to help stimulate
      the development of a general neurobiological theory of the complex symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

AB  - Children and adolescents who develop schizophrenia tend to have greater symptom
      severity than adults who develop the illness. Since the brain continues to mature
      into early adulthood, developmental differences in brain structure and function
      may provide clues to the underlying neurobiology of schizophrenia. With an
      emerging body of evidence supporting disrupted connectivity contributing to the
      underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia, it was our goal to assess
      differences in functional connectivity in children and adolescents who develop
      schizophrenia. Participants included a total of 28 children and adolescents (14
      patients with schizophrenia and 14 age- and gender-matched controls). All
      subjects underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan involving a
      modified Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm with 3 working memory (WkM) loads.
      Patients had poorer performance at all 3 WkM loads without a load by diagnosis
      interaction. Functional imaging results demonstrated 3 specific brain networks
      disrupted in children and adolescents with schizophrenia. These networks include 
      1) the anterior cingulate and the temporal lobes, bilaterally; 2) the cerebellum 
      with subcortical regions; and 3) the occipital lobe and the cerebellum. Patients 
      with early-onset schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal functional connectivity in
      networks involving limbic, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and early visual processing
      streams.

TI  - Differential fractional anisotropy abnormalities in adolescents with ADHD or
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 193-8
LID - 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.10.012 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are associated 
      with similar deficits in working memory, attention, and inhibition. Both
      disorders also involve abnormalities of white matter integrity, possibly
      reflecting neural communication disruptions. There are likely some regional white
      matter abnormalities that underlie the common cognitive impairment, though also
      some regional abnormalities unique to each disorder. We used diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) to compare white matter integrity, as indicated by fractional
      anisotropy (FA), in adolescents with schizophrenia (n=15) or ADHD (n=14) and
      healthy controls (n=26). Schizophrenia patients had uniquely low FA, relative to 
      the other two groups, in bilateral cerebral peduncles, anterior and posterior
      corpus callosum, right anterior corona radiata, and right superior longitudinal
      fasciculus. ADHD patients had uniquely high FA in left inferior and right
      superior frontal regions. Both clinical groups had lower FA than controls in left
      posterior fornix. The two disorders generally demonstrated distinct patterns of
      abnormal connectivity suggesting that common cognitive and behavioral deficits
      derive from distinct sources, though the posterior fornix may be involved in both
      disorders. Schizophrenia was associated with abnormally low FA in widespread
      circuitry indicative of general connectivity disruptions, whereas ADHD was
      associated with abnormally high FA in frontal networks that may indicate impaired
      branching of fibers.

AB  - Earlier studies have shown widespread alterations of functional connectivity of
      various brain networks in schizophrenia, including the default mode network
      (DMN). The DMN has also an important role in the performance of cognitive tasks. 
      Furthermore, treatment with second-generation antipsychotic drugs may ameliorate 
      to some degree working memory (WM) deficits and related brain activity. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate the effects of treatment with olanzapine
      monotherapy on functional connectivity among brain regions of the DMN during WM. 
      Seventeen patients underwent an 8-week prospective study and completed two
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment 
      during the performance of the N-back WM task. To control for potential repetition
      effects, 19 healthy controls also underwent two fMRI scans at a similar time
      interval. We used spatial group-independent component analysis (ICA) to analyze
      fMRI data. Relative to controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced
      connectivity strength within the DMN in posterior cingulate, whereas it was
      greater in precuneus and inferior parietal lobule. Treatment with olanzapine was 
      associated with increases in DMN connectivity with ventromedial prefrontal
      cortex, but not in posterior regions of DMN. These results suggest that treatment
      with olanzapine is associated with the modulation of DMN connectivity in
      schizophrenia. In addition, our findings suggest critical functional differences 
      in the regions of DMN.

TI  - Evidence for anomalous network connectivity during working memory encoding in
      schizophrenia: an ICA based analysis.
PG  - e7911
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0007911 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous neuroimaging studies report abnormal regional brain activity
      during working memory performance in schizophrenia, but few have examined brain
      network integration as determined by "functional connectivity" analyses.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used independent component analysis (ICA) to
      identify and characterize dysfunctional spatiotemporal networks in schizophrenia 
      engaged during the different stages (encoding and recognition) of a Sternberg
      working memory fMRI paradigm. 37 chronic schizophrenia and 54 healthy
      age/gender-matched participants performed a modified Sternberg Item Recognition
      fMRI task. Time series images preprocessed with SPM2 were analyzed using ICA.
      Schizophrenia patients showed relatively less engagement of several distinct
      "normal" encoding-related working memory networks compared to controls. These
      encoding networks comprised 1) left posterior parietal-left dorsal/ventrolateral 
      prefrontal cortex, cingulate, basal ganglia, 2) right posterior parietal, right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 3) default mode network. In addition, the left
      fronto-parietal network demonstrated a load-dependent functional response during 
      encoding. Network engagement that differed between groups during recognition
      comprised the posterior cingulate, cuneus and hippocampus/parahippocampus. As
      expected, working memory task accuracy differed between groups (p<0.0001) and was
      associated with degree of network engagement. Functional connectivity within all 
      three encoding-associated functional networks correlated significantly with task 
      accuracy, which further underscores the relevance of abnormal network integration
      to well-described schizophrenia working memory impairment. No network was
      significantly associated with task accuracy during the recognition phase.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study extends the results of numerous previous
      schizophrenia studies that identified isolated dysfunctional brain regions by
      providing evidence of disrupted schizophrenia functional connectivity using ICA
      within widely-distributed neural networks engaged for working memory cognition.

TI  - Disturbed functional connectivity within brain networks subserving
      domain-specific subcomponents of working memory in schizophrenia: relation to
      performance and clinical symptoms.
PG  - 364-72
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.09.003 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Disturbed interregional functional connectivity has been
      hypothesized to be a promising marker of schizophrenia. The relationship between 
      working memory (WM) impairment, disturbed functional connectivity, and the
      characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia, however, remains elusive. METHODS: We
      used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate in patients with schizophrenia and
      matched controls the patterns of functional connectivity during the performance
      of different tasks selectively engaging subcomponent processes of working memory.
      RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients showed reduced connectivity of the
      prefrontal cortex with the intraparietal cortex and the hippocampus and abnormal 
      negative interactions between the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex during the non-articulatory maintenance of phonological information.
      During the maintenance of visuospatial information, patients presented reduced
      connectivity between regions in the superior parietal and occipital cortex, as
      well as enhanced positive connectivity of the frontal eye field with visual
      processing areas. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest complex dysregulations within 
      the networks supporting working memory functions in schizophrenia, which manifest
      as decreased positive and abnormal negative interactions. Correlations between
      the connection strength and WM performance suggest that these dysregulations may 
      be neurofunctional correlates of the WM deficits seen in schizophrenia. Altered
      prefronto-hippocampal and parieto-occipital connectivity was further found to be 
      associated with higher positive symptoms, providing a possible explanation for
      the development of delusions and disorganization symptoms. CONCLUSION: The
      present findings can help to better understand the relationship between altered
      patterns of synchronized brain activity and the cognitive and clinical symptoms
      of schizophrenia.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia have
      suggested regional brain activation changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      and the medial temporal lobe. However, less is known about the functional
      coupling of these areas during cognitive performance. In this study, we used
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, a verbal working memory (WM) task and
      multivariate statistical techniques to investigate the functional coupling of
      temporally anticorrelated neural networks during cognitive processing in patients
      with schizophrenia (n=16) compared to healthy controls (n=16). Independent
      component analysis identified 18 independent components (ICs) among which two ICs
      were selected for further analyses. These ICs included temporally anticorrelated 
      networks which were most highly associated with the delay period of the task in
      both healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Functional network
      abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia were detected within a
      "task-positive" lateral frontoparietal network, where increased functional
      connectivity was found in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal regions. In addition,
      aberrant functional coupling of the hippocampal cortex in patients with
      schizophrenia was detected within a "task-negative" medial frontotemporal
      network. In patients with schizophrenia, functional connectivity indices in the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right hippocampal cortex were
      positively correlated with accuracy during the WM task, while the connectivity
      strength in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was negatively correlated
      with measures of symptom severity. These data suggest that within two temporally 
      anticorrelated network states, patients with schizophrenia exhibit increased and 
      persistent dorsolateral prefrontal and hippocampal connectivity during WM
      performance.

      cognitive-behavioral therapy in schizophrenia.
PG  - 594-602
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.04.036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the variable response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      when added to antipsychotic medication in psychosis and the evidence for a role
      of pretherapy level of frontal lobe-based cognitive function in responsiveness to
      CBT in other disorders, this study examined whether pretherapy brain activity
      associated with working memory neural network predicts clinical responsiveness to
      CBT in schizophrenia. METHODS: Fifty-two outpatients stable on medication with at
      least one distressing symptom of schizophrenia and willing to receive CBT in
      addition to their usual treatment and 20 healthy participants underwent
      functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric n-back task.
      Subsequently, 26 patients received CBT for psychosis (CBT+treatment-as-usual
      [TAU], 19 completers) for 6-8 months, and 26 continued with TAU alone (17
      completers). Symptoms in both patient groups were assessed (blindly) at entry and
      follow-up. RESULTS: The CBT+TAU and TAU-alone groups did not differ clinically or
      in performance at baseline. The CBT+TAU group showed significant improvement in
      relation to the TAU-alone group, which showed no change, at follow-up. Stronger
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity (within the normal range) and
      DLPFC-cerebellum connectivity during the highest memory load condition (2-back > 
      0-back) were associated with post-CBT clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: DLPFC
      activity and its connectivity with the cerebellum predict responsiveness to CBT
      for psychosis in schizophrenia. These effects may be mediated by PFC-cerebellum
      contributions to executive processing.

TI  - Superior temporal lobe dysfunction and frontotemporal dysconnectivity in subjects
      at risk of psychosis and in first-episode psychosis.
PG  - 4129-37
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20834 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Superior temporal lobe dysfunction is a robust finding in functional 
      neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia and is thought to be related to a
      disruption of fronto-temporal functional connectivity. However, the stage of the 
      disorder at which these functional alterations occur is unclear. We addressed
      this issue by using functional MRI (fMRI) to study subjects in the prodromal and 
      first episode phases of schizophrenia. METHODS: Subjects with an at risk mental
      state (ARMS) for psychosis, a first psychotic episode (FEP), and controls were
      studied using fMRI while performing a working memory task. Activation in the
      superior temporal gyrus (STG) was assessed using statistical parametric mapping, 
      and its relationship to frontal activation was examined using dynamic causal
      modeling. RESULTS: The STG was differentially engaged across the three groups.
      There was deactivation of this region during the task in controls, whereas
      subjects with FEP showed activation and the response in subjects with ARMS was
      intermediately relative to the two other groups. There were corresponding
      differences in the effective connectivity between the STG and the middle frontal 
      gyrus across the three groups, with a negative coupling between these areas in
      controls, a positive coupling in the FEP group, and an intermediate value in the 
      ARMS group. CONCLUSIONS: A failure to deactivate the superior temporal lobe
      during tasks that engage prefrontal cortex is evident at the onset of
      schizophrenia and may reflect a disruption of fronto-temporal connectivity.
      Qualitatively similar alterations are evident in people with prodromal symptoms
      of the disorder.

TI  - An fMRI study of functional abnormalities in the verbal working memory system and
      the relationship to clinical symptoms in chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 46-60
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhp079 [doi]
AB  - There has been evidence for functional abnormalities of the verbal working memory
      system in schizophrenia. Verbal working memory crucially involves the interplay
      between the anterior and posterior language systems, and previous studies have
      shown converging evidence for abnormalities in the posterior language system in
      schizophrenia. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we measured
      cortical activity in chronic schizophrenic patients and matched healthy controls 
      during auditory and visual verbal working memory tasks. We employed 1) regional
      analyses specifically targeting the posterior language system and 2) analyses of 
      functional connectivity between anterior and posterior language regions. We
      performed these analyses separately for each memory stage and modality. In the
      regional analyses, the left sylvian-parietal-temporal (Spt) area consistently
      showed reduced activation during encoding and retrieval stages in schizophrenia. 
      Magnitudes of activation in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus were
      correlated with the severity of delusions at every memory stage. Functional
      connectivity analyses revealed reduced connectivity between the left Spt and the 
      anterior insula during the encoding of auditory words. In addition, the
      connectivity strength was correlated with the severity of auditory
      hallucinations. These findings identify abnormal components in the verbal working
      memory system and illustrate their possible overlap with the mechanisms of core
      schizophrenic symptoms.

      integration in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1809-19
LID - 10.1017/S0033291709005820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the frequently reported working
      memory impairments in schizophrenia might be partly due to an alteration in the
      functional connectivity between task-relevant areas. However, little is known
      about the functional connectivity patterns in schizophrenia patients during
      learning processes. In a previous study, Koch et al. [Neuroscience (2007) 146,
      1474-1483] have demonstrated stronger exponential activation decreases in
      schizophrenia patients during overlearning of short-term memory material. The
      question arises whether these differential temporal patterns of activation in
      schizophrenia patients and controls are going along with changes in task-related 
      functional connectivity. METHOD: Therefore, in the current study, 13 patients
      with schizophrenia and 13 controls were studied while performing a short-term
      memory task associated with increasing overlearning of verbal stimulus material. 
      Functional connectivity was investigated by analyses of psychophysiological
      interactions (PPI). RESULTS: Results revealed significant task-related modulation
      of functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) and a network including the right DLPFC, left ventrolateral prefrontal
      cortex, premotor cortex, right inferior parietal cortex, left and right
      cerebellum as well as the left occipital lobe in patients during the course of
      overlearning and practice. No significant PPI results were detectable in
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Activation changes with practice were associated with high
      functional connectivity between task-relevant areas in schizophrenia patients.
      This could be interpreted as a compensatory resource allocation and network
      integration in the context of cortical inefficiency and may be a specific
      neurophysiological signature underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

TI  - Reduced fronto-temporal connectivity is associated with frontal gray matter
      density reduction and neuropsychological deficit in schizophrenia.
PG  - 57-68
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2008.11.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A "disconnectivity model" of schizophrenia has been proposed, but it 
      is still unclear if white matter abnormalities are associated with gray matter
      changes and if they may be the anatomic substrate of cognitive impairment, which 
      is a core symptom of the disorder. The first objective was to detect if white
      matter microstructure alterations in schizophrenia are associated with or
      independent of gray matter change, using an optimized method for white matter
      (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics) and gray matter analyses (whole-brain voxel-wise
      approach). The second objective was to identify the neuropsychological correlates
      of white matter abnormalities in the schizophrenic group, using a comprehensive
      neuropsychological battery. METHODS: In this case-control study 43 schizophrenic 
      patients and 43 healthy volunteers were consecutively enrolled and matched for
      age and gender. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy reduction was found in 6
      fronto-temporal clusters (corrected p-values <0.05) in schizophrenic group in
      comparison with healthy volunteers, and 3 clusters showed fractional anisotropy
      increase (corrected p-values <0.05). Two of the clusters showing reduced
      fractional anisotropy were associated with reduced gray matter density in
      neuroanatomically-related regions in schizophrenic subjects (p-values ranging
      from 0.001 to 0.026). Executive, constructional-praxis, and working memory
      deficits were significant predictors of fractional anisotropy reduction in 4
      clusters in the schizophrenic group (p-values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0017).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the disconnectivity hypothesis in schizophrenia,
      enlightening a link between reduced fronto-temporal connectivity and "frontal"
      cognitive deficits. Reduced gray matter density may be involved primarily in the 
      pathogenesis of some of these disconnected areas.

TI  - ErbB4 genotype predicts left frontotemporal structural connectivity in human
      brain.
PG  - 641-50
LID - 10.1038/npp.2008.112 [doi]
AB  - Diminished left frontotemporal connectivity is among the most frequently reported
      findings in schizophrenia and there is evidence that altered neuronal myelination
      may in part account for this deficit. Several investigations have suggested that 
      variations of the genes that encode the Neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 receptor
      complex are associated with schizophrenia illness. As NRG1--ErbB4 has been
      implicated in neuronal myelination, we investigated with diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) whether fractional anisotropy (FA)--a putative measure of neuronal
      myelination--is predicted by a risk haplotype of the ErbB4 gene. The effects of
      the ErbB4 genotype were investigated in healthy subjects (N=59; mean age:
      22.6+/-1.8 years). We also measured reaction time (RT) during a selective
      attention/working memory paradigm (visual oddball). In the schizophrenia risk
      genotype group, we found lower FA in the temporal lobe white matter (WM)
      including frontotemporal fiber tracts, predominantly in the left hemisphere. RT
      was increased in the risk genotype group and correlated with FA in the affected
      brain region. As FA is considered to index structural integrity of WM, to which
      neuronal fiber myelination is contributing, our results suggest that variations
      of the ErbB4 genotype may confer risk for schizophrenia illness via its impact on
      left frontotemporal connectivity in human brain. Reliability and validity of the 
      result is suggested by our observation that (1) the FA-genotype association was
      not only obtained in the entire sample but also in both the split halves and (2) 
      a statistical relationship was found among RT, genotype and FA.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and working
      memory in recent-onset schizophrenia.
PG  - 512-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural and functional abnormalities in frontal-parietal circuitry
      are thought to be associated with working memory (WM) deficits in patients with
      schizophrenia. This study examines whether recent-onset schizophrenia is
      associated with anatomical changes in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF),
      the main frontal-parietal white matter connection, and whether the integrity of
      the SLF is related to WM performance. METHODS: We applied a novel registration
      approach (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics [TBSS]) to diffusion tensor imaging data
      to examine fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left and right SLF in 12 young adult
      patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and 17 matched control subjects.
      RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients showed lower FA values than control subjects
      across the entire SLF, with particular deficits on the left SLF. Fractional
      anisotropy values were correlated with performance on a verbal WM task in both
      patient and control groups in the left but not right SLF. CONCLUSIONS:
      Recent-onset schizophrenia patients show deficits in frontal-parietal
      connections, key components of WM circuitry. Moreover, the integrity of this
      physiological connection predicted performance on a verbal WM task, indicating
      that this structural change may have important functional implications. These
      findings support the view that schizophrenia is a disorder of brain connectivity 
      and implicate white matter changes detectable in the early phases of the illness 
      as one source of this dysfunction.

TI  - Neuroimaging of cognitive disability in schizophrenia: search for a
      pathophysiological mechanism.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - This article reviews how functional neuroimaging research of cognitive
      dysfunction in schizophrenia has resulted in a progression of influential
      pathophysiological models of the disorder. The review begins with discussion of
      the 'hypofrontality' model, moving from resting studies examining anterior to
      posterior gradients of cerebral blood flow (CBF), to cognitive activation studies
      employing the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and current functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of working memory and cognitive control
      utilizing parametric task designs and event-related procedures. A similar
      progression is described for development of the temporal lobe model of
      schizophrenia, moving from research on the temporal cortex and language
      processing to the hippocampal formation and long-term memory (LTM). These LTM
      studies found that hippocampal dysfunction was often accompanied by disrupted
      prefrontal function, supporting a hybrid model of impaired fronto-temporal
      connectivity. Developments in image analysis procedures are described that allow 
      assessment of these distributed network models. However, given limitations in
      temporal and spatial resolution, current methods do not provide 'real-time'
      imaging of network activity, making arrival at a definitive pathophysiologic
      mechanism difficult. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) dysfunction and
      disrupted fronto-temporal integration appear to be equally viable current models.
      The article concludes with a discussion of how fMRI can help facilitate
      development of novel psychosocial and pharmacological interventions designed to
      improve cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Allelic variation in RGS4 impacts functional and structural connectivity in the
      human brain.
PG  - 1584-93
AB  - Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) modulates postsynaptic signal
      transduction by affecting the kinetics of G alpha-GTP binding. Linkage,
      association, and postmortem studies have implicated the gene encoding RGS4 (RGS4)
      as a schizophrenia susceptibility factor. Using a multimodal neuroimaging
      approach, we demonstrate that genetic variation in RGS4 is associated with
      functional activation and connectivity during working memory in the absence of
      overt behavioral differences, with regional gray and white matter volume and with
      gray matter structural connectivity in healthy human subjects. Specifically,
      variation at one RGS4 single nucleotide polymorphism that has been associated
      previously with psychosis (rs951436) impacts frontoparietal and frontotemporal
      blood oxygenation level-dependent response and network coupling during working
      memory and results in regionally specific reductions in gray and white matter
      structural volume in individuals carrying the A allele. These findings suggest
      mechanisms in brain for the association of RGS4 with risk for psychiatric
      illness.

TI  - Dysfunctional prefrontal regional specialization and compensation in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 1969-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that in healthy persons higher-order cognitive
      processing engaged by incremental working memory load hierarchically employs more
      dorsal than ventral prefrontal resources in healthy individuals. Given that
      working memory performance is impaired in schizophrenia, especially at higher
      executive loads, the authors investigated how this prefrontal functional
      organization might be altered in disease, independent of performance deficits.
      METHOD: Using N-back working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      data, the authors studied 15 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy
      comparison subjects. Subgroups based on median performance accuracy at 2-back
      were analyzed; high performers included eight schizophrenia patients and 14
      comparison subjects, and low performers included seven patients and 12 comparison
      subjects. RESULTS: High-performing but not low-performing comparison subjects
      responded to incremental working memory executive load with disproportionately
      greater dorsal but not ventral prefrontal cortex activation, which also predicted
      performance accuracy. In the high- and low-performing patient groups, incremental
      working memory load caused a disproportionate increase in ventral but not dorsal 
      prefrontal cortex activation relative to the respective comparison group, which
      also correlated with accuracy. Functional connectivity between the ventral
      prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex was relatively greater in
      patients, whereas comparison subjects had greater functional connectivity between
      the dorsal prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The
      hierarchical organization of the prefrontal cortex may be compromised in
      schizophrenia, resulting in loss of functional specialization and integration at 
      the dorsal prefrontal cortex and in compensatory activation from the ventral
      prefrontal cortex, which may ultimately affect working memory and executive
      cognition.

TI  - Morphological correlates to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia as studied
      with Bayesian regression.
PG  - 31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relationships between cognitive deficits and brain morphological
      changes observed in schizophrenia are alternately explained by less gray matter
      in the brain cerebral cortex, by alterations in neural circuitry involving the
      basal ganglia, and by alteration in cerebellar structures and related neural
      circuitry. This work explored a model encompassing all of these possibilities to 
      identify the strongest morphological relationships to cognitive skill in
      schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy-one patients with schizophrenia and sixty-five
      healthy control subjects were characterized by neuropsychological tests covering 
      six functional domains. Measures of sixteen brain morphological structures were
      taken using semi-automatic and fully manual tracing of MRI images, with the full 
      set of measures completed on thirty of the patients and twenty controls. Group
      differences were calculated. A Bayesian decision-theoretic method identified
      those morphological features, which best explained neuropsychological test scores
      in the context of a multivariate response linear model with interactions.
      RESULTS: Patients performed significantly worse on all neuropsychological tests
      except some regarding executive function. The most prominent morphological
      observations were enlarged ventricles, reduced posterior superior vermis gray
      matter volumes, and increased putamen gray matter volumes in the patients. The
      Bayesian method associated putamen volumes with verbal learning, vigilance, and
      (to a lesser extent) executive function, while caudate volumes were associated
      with working memory. Vermis regions were associated with vigilance, executive
      function, and, less strongly, visuo-motor speed. Ventricular volume was strongly 
      associated with visuo-motor speed, vocabulary, and executive function. Those
      neuropsychological tests, which were strongly associated to ventricular volume,
      showed only weak association to diagnosis, possibly because ventricular volume
      was regarded a proxy for diagnosis. Diagnosis was strongly associated with the
      other neuropsychological tests, implying that the morphological associations for 
      these tasks reflected morphological effects and not merely group volumetric
      differences. Interaction effects were rarely associated, indicating that
      volumetric relationships to neuropsychological performance were similar for both 
      patients and controls. CONCLUSION: The association of subcortical and cerebellar 
      structures to verbal learning, vigilance, and working memory supports the
      importance of neural connectivity to these functions. The finding that a
      morphological indicator of diagnosis (ventricular volume) provided more
      explanatory power than diagnosis itself for visuo-motor speed, vocabulary, and
      executive function suggests that volumetric abnormalities in the disease are more
      important for cognition than non-morphological features.

TI  - A method for multitask fMRI data fusion applied to schizophrenia.
PG  - 598-610
AB  - It is becoming common to collect data from multiple functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) paradigms on a single individual. The data from these experiments 
      are typically analyzed separately and sometimes directly subtracted from one
      another on a voxel-by-voxel basis. These comparative approaches, although useful,
      do not directly attempt to examine potential commonalities between tasks and
      between voxels. To remedy this we propose a method to extract maximally spatially
      independent maps for each task that are "coupled" together by a shared loading
      parameter. We first compute an activation map for each task and each individual
      as "features," which are then used to perform joint independent component
      analysis (jICA) on the group data. We demonstrate our approach on a data set
      derived from healthy controls and schizophrenia patients, each of which carried
      out an auditory oddball task and a Sternberg working memory task. Our analysis
      approach revealed two interesting findings in the data that were missed with
      traditional analyses. First, consistent with our hypotheses, schizophrenia
      patients demonstrate "decreased" connectivity in a joint network including
      portions of regions implicated in two prevalent models of schizophrenia. A second
      finding is that for the voxels identified by the jICA analysis, the correlation
      between the two tasks was significantly higher in patients than in controls. This
      finding suggests that schizophrenia patients activate "more similarly" for both
      tasks than do controls. A possible synthesis of both findings is that patients
      are activating less, but also activating with a less-unique set of regions for
      these very different tasks. Both of the findings described support the claim that
      examination of joint activation across multiple tasks can enable new questions to
      be posed about fMRI data. Our approach can also be applied to data using more
      than two tasks. It thus provides a way to integrate and probe brain networks
      using a variety of tasks and may increase our understanding of coordinated brain 
      networks and the impact of pathology upon them.

TI  - Nicotine effects on brain function and functional connectivity in schizophrenia.
PG  - 850-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotine in tobacco smoke can improve functioning in multiple
      cognitive domains. High rates of smoking among schizophrenic patients may reflect
      an effort to remediate cognitive dysfunction. Our primary aim was to determine
      whether nicotine improves cognitive function by facilitating activation of brain 
      regions mediating task performance or by facilitating functional connectivity.
      METHODS: Thirteen smokers with schizophrenia and 13 smokers with no mental
      illness were withdrawn from tobacco and underwent functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) scanning twice, once after placement of a placebo patch and once
      after placement of a nicotine patch. During scanning, subjects performed an
      n-back task with two levels of working memory load and of selective attention
      load. RESULTS: During the most difficult (dichotic 2-back) task condition,
      nicotine improved performance of schizophrenic subjects and worsened performance 
      of control subjects. Nicotine also enhanced activation of a network of regions,
      including anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral thalamus, and modulated
      thalamocortical functional connectivity to a greater degree in schizophrenic than
      in control subjects during dichotic 2-back task performance. CONCLUSIONS: In
      tasks that tax working memory and selective attention, nicotine may improve
      performance in schizophrenia patients by enhancing activation of and functional
      connectivity between brain regions that mediate task performance.

TI  - Altered effective connectivity in drug free schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 2233-7
AB  - The present fMRI study aimed to investigate effective connectivity within a
      cortical-subcortical-cerebellar information processing network in drug free
      schizophrenic patients while performing a 2-back working memory task. The finding
      of enhanced thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical intrahemispheric connectivity
      could be interpreted as a compensatory increase of neuronal connection strength
      consistent with a model of cortical inefficiency in schizophrenic patients.
      Additionally, the result could be integrated into a model of deficient
      thalamo-cortical filter functions. Conversely, lower interhemispheric
      connectivity of the frontal and parietal association cortex appears to be the
      functional correlate of reduced cognitive performance in schizophrenic patients. 
      The study demonstrated the feasibility to model information processing within
      cognitive networks and provided additional evidence for the concept of cognitive 
      dysmetria in schizophrenia.

TI  - Augmenting atypical antipsychotics with a cognitive enhancer (donepezil) improves
      regional brain activity in schizophrenia patients: a pilot double-blind placebo
      controlled BOLD fMRI study.
PG  - 274-82
AB  - Cognitive impairments are cardinal features of schizophrenia and predictors of
      poor vocational and social outcome. Imaging studies with verbal fluency tasks
      (VFT) lead some to suggest that in schizophrenia, the combination of a failure to
      deactivate the left temporal lobe and a hypoactive frontal lobe reflects a
      functional disconnectivity between the left prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. 
      Others have theorized that an abnormal cingulate gyrus modulates such
      fronto-temporal connectivity. Thus addition of a cognitive enhancing medication
      to current antipsychotic therapy might improve functionality of networks
      necessary in working memory and internal concept generation. To test this
      hypothesis, we serially measured brain activity in 6 subjects on stable atypical 
      antipsychotics performing a VFT, using BOLD fMRI. Measurements were made at
      baseline and again after groups were randomized to receive 12 weeks of donepezil 
      (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and placebo in a blind cross-over design.
      Donepezil addition provided a functional normalization with an increase in left
      frontal lobe and cingulate activity when compared to placebo and from baseline
      scans. This pilot study supports the cingulate's role in modulating cognition and
      neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia.

TI  - Altered effective connectivity during working memory performance in
      schizophrenia: a study with fMRI and structural equation modeling.
PG  - 751-63
AB  - The present study aimed to explore altered effective connectivity in
      schizophrenic patients while performing a 2-back working memory task. Twelve
      right-handed, schizophrenic patients treated with typical or atypical
      antipsychotics and 6 healthy control subjects were studied with fMRI while
      performing a "2-back" working memory task. Effective connectivity within a
      cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for mnemonic information processing was
      assessed and compared between both groups. The path model included
      cortico-cortical connections comprising the parietal association cortex,
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) as well as a cortico-cerebellar feedback loop comprising prefrontal
      cortex, contralateral cerebellum, and thalamus. Group differences were analyzed
      with a stacked models approach. Relative to normal controls, both patient groups 
      revealed a pattern of reduced connectivity within the prefrontal-cerebellar and
      the cerebellar-thalamic limbs but enhanced connectivity in the thalamo-cortical
      limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuit. Moreover, a direct comparison of both
      treatment groups revealed enhanced connectivity in the interhemispheric
      connections between the cortical association areas in patients treated with
      atypical antipsychotics. However, right prefrontal and left parieto-frontal path 
      coefficients were lower in the patient group receiving atypical antispychotic
      drugs. The findings suggest that the relationship between pathology in
      cortical-subcortical cerebellar networks and associated functional connectivity
      is complex and may include aspects of increased and decreased levels of
      connectivity consistent with the notion of "cognitive dysmetria" in
      schizophrenia. The observed pronounced connectivity within thalamo-cortical
      projections could be attributed to a compensatory increase of thalamic input in
      the presence of disrupted effective connectivity within the preceding limb of the
      cortical-cerebellar circuitry. The study demonstrated the feasibility of
      structural equation modeling for the investigation of group and treatment-related
      differences in effective connectivity and provides a promising approach to
      further disentangle the relationship between altered functional capacity and
      associated fMRI signal changes.

TI  - Specific relationship between prefrontal neuronal N-acetylaspartate and
      activation of the working memory cortical network in schizophrenia.
PG  - 26-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abnormal activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a
      related cortical network during working memory tasks has been demonstrated in
      patients with schizophrenia, but the responsible mechanism has not been
      identified. The present study was performed to determine whether neuronal
      pathology of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is linked to the activation of
      the working memory cortical network in patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: The
      brains of 13 patients with schizophrenia and 13 comparison subjects were studied 
      with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic ((1)H-MRS) imaging (to measure
      N-acetylaspartate as a marker of neuronal pathology) and with [(15)O]water
      positron emission tomography (PET) during performance of the Wisconsin Card
      Sorting Test (to measure activation of the working memory cortical network). An
      independent cohort of patients (N=7) was also studied in a post hoc experiment
      with (1)H-MRS imaging and with the same PET technique during performance of
      another working memory task (the "N-back" task). RESULTS: Measures of
      N-acetylaspartate in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex strongly correlated with 
      activation of the distributed working memory network, including the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal, temporal, and inferior parietal cortices, during both working memory 
      tasks in the two independent groups of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, 
      N-acetylaspartate in other cortical regions and in comparison subjects did not
      show these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These findings directly implicate a
      population of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurons as selectively accounting
      for the activity of the distributed working memory cortical network in
      schizophrenia and complement other evidence that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      connectivity is fundamental to the pathophysiology of the disorder.
