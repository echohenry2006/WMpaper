      vulnerability indicators for schizophrenia: a MRI study of non-psychotic

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clues to the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia can be
      examined in their first-degree relatives because they are genetically related to 
      an ill family member, and have few confounds like medications. Brain
      abnormalities observed in young relatives are neurobiological indicators of
      vulnerability to illness. We examined the hypothesis that the hippocampus and
      parahippocampus are structurally abnormal and are related to default mode network
      (DMN) function and cognitive abnormalities in relatives of probands. METHODS:
      Subjects were 27 non-psychotic, first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed
      with schizophrenia, and 48 normal controls, ages 13 to 28, undergoing
      high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T. After structural scan 
      acquisition a subset of subjects performed 2-back working memory (WM) and 0-back 
      tasks during functional MRI (fMRI) alternating with rest. fMRI data were analyzed
      using SPM-8. Volumes of total cerebrum, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus
      were measured using semi-automated morphometry. RESULTS: Compared to controls,
      relatives had significantly smaller left hippocampi, without volumetric reduction
      in the parahippocampus. Relatives showed significantly less suppression of DMN
      activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Left hippocampal and posterior
      parahippocampal volumes were inversely and significantly associated with DMN
      processing (smaller volumes, less suppression) in relatives. Task suppression in 
      parahippocampal gyrus significantly correlated with WM performance within the
      relatives. CONCLUSION: Results support the hypothesis that the vulnerability to
      schizophrenia includes smaller hippocampi and DMN suppression deficits, and these
      are associated with poorer WM. Findings suggest a primary structural,
      neurodevelopmental, medial temporal lobe abnormality associated with altered DMN 
      function independent of psychosis.

AB  - Working memory (WM) deficit is an important component of impaired cognition in
      schizophrenia. However, between-studies inconsistencies as to the specific
      functional substrate imply that inter-individual variability (IIV) in the WM
      performance is associated with IIV in brain activity in schizophrenia. To examine
      the neural substrate of this WM IIV, we studied whether the neural mechanisms
      that underlie individual differences in WM capacity are the same in schizophrenia
      patients and healthy people. We correlated the IIV of the task-evoked brain
      activity and task performance during an n-back WM task with the IIV of the
      moment-to-moment variability in intrinsic resting-state activity, as measured by 
      the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and further compared this
      relationship between 17 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and 18
      healthy controls. Between-group comparisons of the correlation patterns indicated
      aberrant ALFF-WM activation correlations and ALFF-WM performance correlations in 
      the FES patients, but no significant changes were detected in any single
      measurement of these three characteristics. Specifically, we found increased
      positive ALFF-WM activation correlations in the bilateral lateral prefrontal
      cortices, posterior parietal cortices and fusiform gyri in the FES patients. We
      also observed significant increases in positive ALFF-WM performance correlations 
      in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortices in the FES patients. This
      hyper-coupling between the ALFF and fMRI measures during a WM task may indicate
      that it was difficult for the patients to detach themselves from one state to
      transition to another and suggests that the inefficient cortical function in
      schizophrenia stems from the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain.

AB  - The anterior insula is a multifunctional region involved in various cognitive,
      perceptual and socio-emotional processes. In particular, a portion of the left
      anterior insula is closely associated with working memory processes in healthy
      participants and shows gray matter reduction in schizophrenia. To unravel the
      functional networks related to this left anterior insula region, we here combined
      resting state connectivity, meta-analytic-connectivity modeling (MACM) and
      structural covariance (SC) in addition to functional characterization based on
      BrainMap meta-data. Apart from allowing new insight into the seed region, this
      approach moreover provided an opportunity to systematically compare these
      different connectivity approaches. The results showed that the left anterior
      insula has a broad response profile and is part of multiple functional networks
      including language, memory and socio-emotional networks. As all these domains are
      linked with several symptoms of schizophrenia, dysfunction of the left anterior
      insula might be a crucial component contributing to this disorder. Moreover,
      although converging connectivity across all three connectivity approaches for the
      left anterior insula were found, also striking differences were observed. RS and 
      MACM as functional connectivity approaches specifically revealed functional
      networks linked with internal cognition and active perceptual/language processes,
      respectively. SC, in turn, showed a clear preference for highlighting regions
      involved in social cognition. These differential connectivity results thus
      indicate that the use of multiple forms of connectivity is advantageous when
      investigating functional networks as conceptual differences between these
      approaches might lead to systematic variation in the revealed functional
      networks.

TI  - The impact of MIR137 on dorsolateral prefrontal-hippocampal functional
      connectivity in healthy subjects.
PG  - 2153-60
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.63 [doi]
AB  - A recent mega-analysis combining genome-wide association study data revealed that
      a variant of microRNA 137 (MIR137) exhibits the most significant association with
      schizophrenia. Other biological evidence also consistently suggests that MIR137
      may have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the
      underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. As the disrupted dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) coupling with the hippocampal formation (HF) has been
      widely observed in schizophrenia patients, DLPFC-HF dysconnectivity can therefore
      be thought of as a pivotal intermediate phenotype that links genetic variants of 
      psychiatric risk genes to schizophrenia. This study used resting-state functional
      magnetic resonance imaging to test whether the MIR137 variant (rs1625579) impacts
      DLPFC-HF functional connectivity and cognitive performance in 290 young, healthy 
      Han Chinese individuals. To identify functional connectivity between DLPFC and
      HF, a seed-based functional connectivity analysis was used. The association
      between DLPFC-HF connectivity and working memory performance was further examined
      in individuals with different MIR137 genotypes. The individuals who are
      homozygous for the MIR137 risk allele (TT), which confers a high risk for
      schizophrenia, exhibited significantly different DLPFC-HF functional connectivity
      compared with TG individuals. Moreover, the DLPFC-HF connectivity could predict
      the working memory performance in MIR137 TG individuals, but not in TT
      individuals. The current findings obtained in a large sample of healthy
      participants identified potential neural mechanisms linking MIR137 with the risk 
      of developing schizophrenia via the intermediate phenotype of DLPFC-HF
      connectivity.

AB  - Converging electrophysiological evidence suggests that the alpha rhythm plays an 
      important and active role in cognitive processing. Here, we systematically
      studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within
      subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under
      three experimental conditions - rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back
      working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha
      activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency
      differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and
      looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both
      regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and
      passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a
      significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back
      condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency
      during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha
      peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3 
      Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9 Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8 Hz. We also
      measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest,
      found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak
      frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases
      with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a
      wider frequency range than the 8-12 Hz band many studies tend to include in their
      analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results
      against certain subjects and conditions.

LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13070981 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identification of biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction in
      schizophrenia is a priority for psychiatry research. Functional imaging studies
      suggest that intrinsic "resting state" hippocampal hyperactivity is a
      characteristic feature of schizophrenia. The relationships between this phenotype
      and symptoms of the illness, however, are largely unexplored. The authors
      examined resting hippocampal activity in schizophrenia patients and healthy
      comparison subjects and analyzed the relationship between intrinsic hippocampal
      activity and cognitive function in patients as measured by the MATRICS Consensus 
      Cognitive Battery (MCCB). METHOD: Twenty-eight schizophrenia patients and 28
      age-matched healthy comparison subjects underwent functional "resting state" 3-T 
      MR scanning. Hippocampal activity was extracted by group independent component
      analysis. Correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between
      hippocampal activity and MCCB composite and domain scores in patients, as well as
      between hippocampal activity and positive and negative symptoms. RESULTS: Greater
      activity of the right hippocampus at rest was observed in patients relative to
      comparison subjects. In patients, a significant negative correlation was observed
      between right hippocampal activity and composite MCCB T-score. The correlation
      was driven by the MCCB domains of attention/vigilance, working memory, and visual
      learning. Hippocampal activity was positively correlated with negative symptoms. 
      MCCB scores were inversely correlated with negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings suggest that greater intrinsic hippocampal activity is a characteristic 
      feature of schizophrenia that is broadly associated with cognitive dysfunction,
      and they support hippocampal activity as a candidate biomarker for therapeutic
      development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is considered a schizophrenia 
      spectrum disorder, sharing with schizophrenia cognitive, neuropsychological,
      epidemiological, and biological characteristics. Working memory may be one area
      of shared deficit, although to date, this is only the second study to investigate
      working memory in SPD using fMRI. METHODS: In a block-design fMRI study, fifteen 
      antipsychotic-naive SPD and sixteen healthy control subjects performed blocks of 
      a 2back visual working memory task and 0back continuous performance task while
      undergoing whole-brain fMRI at 3T. Whole-brain analyses were performed for the
      0back>rest (fixation baseline) and the 2back>0back contrasts (isolating the
      working memory component from the visual perception and attention component).
      Parameter estimates were extracted to determine whether observed differences were
      due to task-induced activation and/or deactivation. RESULTS: Activation
      differences emerged between the two groups, without differences in task
      performance. In the 0back task, SPD showed decreased task-induced activation of
      the left postcentral gyrus. In the 2back>0back contrast, HC showed greater
      task-induced activation of the left posterior cingulate gyrus, superior temporal 
      gyrus, insula, and middle frontal gyrus. These differences were due to SPD
      subjects' decreased task-induced activation in the left posterior cingulate
      gyrus, and task-induced deactivation in the remaining regions. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings suggest that compared to HC subjects, individuals with SPD may achieve
      comparable working memory performance. However, differences emerge at the level
      of functional neural activation, attributable to different task-induced
      activation and deactivation patterns. Such differential recruitment of neural
      resources may be beneficial, contributing to SPD subjects' ability to perform
      these tasks comparably to HC subjects.

      schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0076604 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The cerebral resting state in schizophrenia is altered, as has been
      demonstrated separately by electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state networks (RSNs). Previous simultaneous
      EEG/fMRI findings in healthy controls suggest that a consistent spatiotemporal
      coupling between neural oscillations (EEG frequency correlates) and RSN activity 
      is necessary to organize cognitive processes optimally. We hypothesized that this
      coupling is disorganized in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, in
      particular regarding higher cognitive RSNs such as the default-mode (DMN) and
      left-working-memory network (LWMN). METHODS: Resting state was investigated in
      eleven patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = 11) and matched
      healthy controls (n = 11) using simultaneous EEG/fMRI. The temporal association
      of each RSN to topographic spectral changes in the EEG was assessed by creating
      Covariance Maps. Group differences within, and group similarities across
      frequencies were estimated for the Covariance Maps. RESULTS: The coupling of EEG 
      frequency bands to the DMN and the LWMN respectively, displayed significant
      similarities that were shifted towards lower EEG frequencies in patients compared
      to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: By combining EEG and fMRI, each measuring
      different properties of the same pathophysiology, an aberrant relationship
      between EEG frequencies and altered RSNs was observed in patients. RSNs of
      patients were related to lower EEG frequencies, indicating functional alterations
      of the spatiotemporal coupling. SIGNIFICANCE: The finding of a deviant and
      shifted coupling between RSNs and related EEG frequencies in patients with a
      schizophrenia spectrum disorder is significant, as it might indicate how failures
      in the processing of internal and external stimuli, as commonly seen during this 
      symptomatology (i.e. thought disorders, hallucinations), arise.

TI  - Prefrontal brain network connectivity indicates degree of both schizophrenia risk
      and cognitive dysfunction.
PG  - 653-64
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbt077 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia, and persons 
      at risk for schizophrenia may show subtle deficits in attention and working
      memory. In this study, we investigated the relationship between integrity of
      functional brain networks and performance in attention and working memory tasks
      as well as schizophrenia risk. METHODS: A total of 235 adults representing 3
      levels of risk (102 outpatients with schizophrenia, 70 unaffected first-degree
      relatives of persons with schizophrenia, and 63 unrelated healthy controls [HCs])
      completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and a battery of
      attention and working memory tasks (Brief Test of Attention, Hopkins Verbal
      Learning Test, and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test) on the same day. Functional
      networks were defined based on coupling with seeds in the dorsal anterior
      cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial prefrontal
      cortex (MPFC), and primary visual cortex. Networks were then dissected into
      regional clusters of connectivity that were used to generate individual
      interaction matrices representing functional connectivity within each network.
      RESULTS: Both patients with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives showed
      cognitive dysfunction compared with HCs. First canonicals indicated an inverse
      relationship between cognitive performance and connectivity within the DLPFC and 
      MPFC networks. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed multivariate main
      effects of higher schizophrenia risk status on increased connectivity within the 
      DLPFC and MPFC networks. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that excessive
      connectivity within brain networks coupled to the DLPFC and MPFC, respectively,
      accompany cognitive deficits in persons at risk for schizophrenia. This might
      reflect compensatory reactions in neural systems required for cognitive
      processing of attention and working memory tasks to brain changes associated with
      schizophrenia.

AB  - Executive dysfunction is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Functional
      neuro-imaging studies have suggested an association between deficits in
      activating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and executive dysfunction, 
      but neuro-integration from the DLPFC to the whole brain remains unclear. Studies 
      investigating the neuro-integration from the DLPFC to the whole brain in
      unaffected but genetically liable family members are scant. In this study, we
      report DLPFC neuro-integrative deficits correlated with executive dysfunction and
      family history of schizophrenia using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). Using seed regions in DLPFC, we examined resting-state functional
      connectivity in 25 patients with schizophrenia, 25 unaffected first-degree
      relatives (UR), and 25 healthy control (HC) persons. Schizophrenia patients and
      UR have impaired connectivity from DLPFC to its coordinated regions (ANOVA:
      F=7.316-10.974, p<0.001). These coordinated brain regions are distributed in the 
      bilateral caudate, left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and
      right cerebellum. The individual functional connectivity strength between the
      left DLPFC and its coordinated regions was correlated with individual executive
      function performance among whole persons. (Pearson's r=0.244-0.366,
      p=0.035-0.008) Our findings support that distributed neuro-integrative DLPFC
      deficits reflect a genetic risk for schizophrenia and that these deficits are
      present, to a lesser degree, in unaffected first-degree relatives. Our findings
      also support that neuro-integration might correlate with a patient's executive
      function performance.

AB  - Neural plasticity is crucial for understanding the experience-dependent
      reorganization of brain regulatory circuits and the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. An important circuit-level feature derived from functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is prefrontal-hippocampal seeded connectivity
      during working memory, the best established intermediate connectivity phenotype
      of schizophrenia risk to date. The phenotype is a promising marker for the
      effects of plasticity-enhancing interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and can be studied in healthy
      volunteers in the absence of illness-related confounds, but the relationship to
      brain plasticity is unexplored. We recruited 39 healthy volunteers to investigate
      the effects of 5 Hz rTMS on prefrontal-hippocampal coupling during working memory
      and rest. In a randomized and sham-controlled experiment, neuronavigation-guided 
      rTMS was applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and fMRI
      and functional connectivity analyses [seeded connectivity and psychophysiological
      interaction (PPI)] were used as readouts. Moreover, the test-retest reliability
      of working-memory related connectivity markers was evaluated. rTMS provoked a
      significant decrease in seeded functional connectivity of the right DLPFC and
      left hippocampus during working memory that proved to be relatively
      time-invariant and robust. PPI analyses provided evidence for a nominal effect of
      rTMS and poor test-retest reliability. No effects on n-back-related activation
      and DLPFC-hippocampus resting-state connectivity were observed. These data
      provide the first in vivo evidence for the effects of plasticity induction on
      human prefrontal-hippocampal network dynamics, offer insights into the biological
      mechanisms of a well established intermediate phenotype linked to schizophrenia, 
      and underscores the importance of the choice of outcome measures in test-retest
      designs.

      impairment in recent onset schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments are present during the early course of
      schizophrenia, and the contribution of GABAergic dysfunction to these cognitive
      impairments has received increasing attention. Cortical GABAergic inhibition can 
      be assessed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in a
      paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS). The aim of this study was
      to examine the relationship between cortical GABAergic inhibition and cognitive
      function in recent onset schizophrenia patients using ppTMS and a
      neuropsychological battery. METHODS: The subjects were 20 healthy controls (HC
      group) and 20 patients with schizophrenia whose duration of illness was less than
      three years (SZ group). All subjects underwent ppTMS measurements of SICI and
      intracortical facilitation (ICF), and cognitive performance of the SZ group was
      assessed using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia
      Japanese-language version. We examined group differences in ppTMS measurements
      (resting motor threshold, SICI, and ICF). In the SZ group, we assessed the
      relationship between SICI and cognitive performance, and the relationships
      between SICI and age, duration of illness, medications, and psychopathology.
      RESULTS: The SZ group showed a significant reduction of SICI compared to the HC
      group, and demonstrated a significant correlation between the reduction of SICI
      and impaired performance of a working memory task. The HC and the SZ groups did
      not differ significantly in resting motor threshold and ICF. The SZ group did not
      show any significant correlations between SICI and age, duration of illness,
      medications, or psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the
      reduction of cortical GABAergic inhibition is related to impairment of working
      memory in patients with recent onset schizophrenia.

      predicts hippocampal function in medication-free patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 713-20
LID - 10.1038/mp.2012.187 [doi]
AB  - A Val(66)Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene impairs activity-dependent BDNF release in
      cultured hippocampal neurons and predicts impaired memory and exaggerated basal
      hippocampal activity in healthy humans. Several clinical genetic association
      studies along with multi-modal evidence for hippocampal dysfunction in
      schizophrenia indirectly suggest a relationship between schizophrenia and
      genetically determined BDNF function in the hippocampus. To directly test this
      hypothesized relationship, we studied 47 medication-free patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 74 healthy comparison individuals
      with genotyping for the Val(66)Met SNP and [(15)O]H(2)O positron emission
      tomography (PET) to measure resting and working memory-related hippocampal
      regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In patients, harboring a Met allele was
      associated with significantly less hippocampal rCBF. This finding was opposite to
      the genotype effect seen in healthy participants, resulting in a significant
      diagnosis-by-genotype interaction. Exploratory analyses of interregional resting 
      rCBF covariation revealed a specific and significant diagnosis-by-genotype
      interaction effect on hippocampal-prefrontal coupling. A diagnosis-by-genotype
      interaction was also found for working memory-related hippocampal rCBF change,
      which was uniquely attenuated in Met allele-carrying patients. Thus, both
      task-independent and task-dependent hippocampal neurophysiology accommodates a
      Met allelic background differently in patients with schizophrenia than in control
      subjects. Potentially consistent with the hypothesis that cellular sequelae of
      the BDNF Val(66)Met SNP interface with aspects of schizophrenic hippocampal and
      frontotemporal dysfunction, these results warrant future investigation to
      understand the contributions of unique patient trait or state variables to these 
      robust interactions.

AB  - In schizophrenia patients negative symptoms and cognitive impairment often
      persist despite treatment with second generation antipsychotics leading to
      reduced quality of life and psychosocial functioning. One core cognitive deficit 
      is impaired working memory (WM) suggesting malfunctioning of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex. High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) has been used to transiently facilitate or consolidate neuronal processes.
      Pilot studies using rTMS have demonstrated improvement of psychopathology in
      other psychiatric disorders, but a systematic investigation of working memory
      effects outlasting the stimulation procedure has not been performed so far. The
      aim of our study was to explore the effect of a 3-week high frequency active or
      sham 10 Hz rTMS on cognition, specifically on working memory, in schizophrenia
      patients (n=25) in addition to antipsychotic therapy and in healthy controls
      (n=22). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare
      activation patterns during verbal WM (letter 2-back task) before and after
      3-weeks treatment with rTMS. Additionally, other cognitive tasks were conducted. 
      10 Hz rTMS was applied over the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (EEG
      electrode location F3) with an intensity of 110% of the individual resting motor 
      threshold (RMT) over a total of 15 sessions. Participants recruited the common
      fronto- parietal and subcortical WM network. Multiple regression analyses
      revealed no significant activation differences over time in any contrast or
      sample. According to the ANOVAs for repeated measures performance remained
      without alterations in all groups. This is the first fMRI study that has
      systematically investigated this topic within a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind design, contrasting the effects in schizophrenia patients and
      healthy controls.

AB  - Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is a fundamental issue in brain
      network construction and analysis. Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal
      neuroimaging approaches and joint analysis strategies are crucial for accurate,
      reliable and individualized identification of brain ROIs. In this paper, we
      present a novel approach of visual analytics and its open-source software for ROI
      definition and brain network construction. By combining neuroscience knowledge
      and computational intelligence capabilities, visual analytics can generate
      accurate, reliable and individualized ROIs for brain networks via joint modeling 
      of multimodal neuroimaging data and an intuitive and real-time visual analytics
      interface. Furthermore, it can be used as a functional ROI optimization and
      prediction solution when fMRI data is unavailable or inadequate. We have applied 
      this approach to an operation span working memory fMRI/DTI dataset, a
      schizophrenia DTI/resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) dataset, and a mild cognitive
      impairment DTI/R-fMRI dataset, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      visual analytics. Our experimental results are encouraging.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with abnormal function of the default
      mode network (DMN), a distributed network of brain regions more active during
      rest than during performance of many attention-demanding tasks and characterized 
      by a high degree of functional connectivity (i.e., temporal correlations between 
      brain regions). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed that 
      the DMN in the healthy brain is associated with stimulus-independent thought and 
      self-reflection and that greater suppression of the DMN is associated with better
      performance on attention-demanding tasks. In schizophrenia and depression, the
      DMN is often found to be hyperactivated and hyperconnected. In schizophrenia this
      may relate to overly intensive self-reference and impairments in attention and
      working memory. In depression, DMN hyperactivity may be related to negative
      rumination. These findings are considered in terms of what is known about
      psychological functions supported by the DMN, and alteration of the DMN in other 
      neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - The cingulo-opercular network (CON) is a newly defined control network
      responsible for various cognitive processes that have been consistently found to 
      be impaired in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to use functional
      connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to test the hypothesis that
      schizophrenia is associated with functional disconnection within the CON. Thirty 
      subjects with schizophrenia and thirty healthy controls were enrolled in the
      study. Each subject received resting fMRI scanning, clinical evaluations and
      cognitive examinations. The CON of each subject was derived by calculating the
      functional connectivity map of a seed in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). A 
      between-group comparison was performed using a random effect analysis. Further
      network analyses with multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were performed to
      characterize the pattern of functional disconnection within the entire CON. Using
      the dACC seed in healthy controls, we derived the CON, which includes the
      following anatomical structures: the dACC; the bilateral anterior prefrontal,
      inferior parietal and anterior insular cortices; the putamen; the thalamus; and
      the cerebellum. Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenic patients showed
      significantly reduced functional connectivity in the bilateral putamens. Further 
      network analysis demonstrated widespread cortico-striatal disconnection within
      the CON of schizophrenic patients. The disconnections correlated with negative
      symptom severity. Behavioral regression revealed that cortico-striatal functional
      connectivity predicted 2-back working memory performance in healthy controls, but
      not in schizophrenic patients. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia is
      associated with cortical-striatal disconnection within the CON. The result
      provides a network basis for the cortico-striatal disconnection hypothesis of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Altered cortical network dynamics: a potential intermediate phenotype for
      schizophrenia and association with ZNF804A.
PG  - 1207-17
LID - 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.103 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Studies have shown patterns of abnormal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) functional connectivity with other brain areas in schizophrenia and
      association of these patterns with a putative susceptibility gene (ZNF804A).
      However, whether these patterns are trait phenomena linked to genetic risk for
      illness is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that altered DLPFC
      connectivity is (1) a familial, likely heritable feature of genetic risk for
      schizophrenia, (2) a novel intermediate phenotype independent of altered DLPFC
      engagement, and (3) selectively modulated by a polymorphism in ZNF804A. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional case-control study using blood oxygen level-dependent functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory task and genotyping of
      rs1344706 in ZNF804A. SETTING: Research center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 402
      subjects (153 cognitively normal controls, 171 healthy siblings of patients with 
      schizophrenia, and 78 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Task-independent and
      task-dependent physiologic coupling between the DLPFC and other brain "target"
      regions investigated with (1) seeded connectivity and (2) psychophysiological
      interaction analysis. RESULTS: Siblings and patients showed greater DLPFC
      "inefficiency" than controls. Abnormal DLPFC functional coupling with the
      hippocampus and, to a lesser degree, the rest of the prefrontal cortex, was
      observed in patients and siblings when compared with controls using both
      connectivity analyses. Prefrontal activation and connectivity measures within
      siblings did not correlate, implying that they were independent phenomena. The
      ZNF804A genotype significantly modulated DLPFC coupling with the hippocampus and 
      prefrontal cortex but not DLPFC activity in the control group. Similarly, ZNF804A
      genotype modulated right DLPFC-hippocampal formation coupling in siblings and
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Coupling between the DLPFC and hippocampus is compromised 
      in siblings of patients with schizophrenia and is independent of DLPFC
      engagement. The selective association with a single-nucleotide polymorphism in
      ZNF804A suggests that this intermediate phenotype proxies a distinct neural
      system mechanism related to genetic risk for schizophrenia and the biology of
      this gene.

TI  - Variable global dysconnectivity and individual differences in schizophrenia.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.02.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A fundamental challenge for understanding neuropsychiatric disease is
      identifying sources of individual differences in psychopathology, especially when
      there is substantial heterogeneity of symptom expression, such as is found in
      schizophrenia (SCZ). We hypothesized that such heterogeneity might arise in part 
      from consistently widespread yet variably patterned alterations in the
      connectivity of focal brain regions. METHODS: We used resting state functional
      connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to identify variable global
      dysconnectivity in 23 patients with DSM-IV SCZ relative to 22 age-, gender-, and 
      parental socioeconomic status-matched control subjects with a novel global brain 
      connectivity method that is robust to high variability across individuals. We
      examined cognitive functioning with a modified Sternberg task and subtests from
      the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. We measured symptom severity
      with the Scale for Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. RESULTS: We
      identified a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) region with global and highly
      variable dysconnectivity involving within-PFC underconnectivity and non-PFC
      overconnectivity in patients. Variability in this "under/over" pattern of
      dysconnectivity strongly predicted the severity of cognitive deficits (matrix
      reasoning IQ, verbal IQ, and working memory performance) as well as individual
      differences in every cardinal symptom domain of SCZ (poverty, reality distortion,
      and disorganization). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that global
      dysconnectivity underlies dorsolateral PFC involvement in the neuropathology of
      SCZ. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the possibility that specific
      patterns of dysconnectivity with a given network hub region might explain
      individual differences in symptom presentation in SCZ. Critically, such findings 
      might extend to other neuropathologies with diverse presentation.

      symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB  - The lack of efficacy for antipsychotics with respect to negative symptoms and
      cognitive deficits is a significant obstacle for the treatment of schizophrenia. 
      Developing new drugs to target these symptoms requires appropriate neural
      biomarkers that can be investigated in model organisms, be used to track
      treatment response, and provide insight into pathophysiological disease
      mechanisms. A growing body of evidence indicates that neural oscillations in the 
      gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) are disturbed in schizophrenia. Gamma synchrony 
      has been shown to mediate a host of sensory and cognitive functions, including
      perceptual encoding, selective attention, salience, and working memory -
      neurocognitive processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and largely
      refractory to treatment. This review summarizes the current state of clinical
      literature with respect to gamma-band responses (GBRs) in schizophrenia, focusing
      on resting and auditory paradigms. Next, preclinical studies of schizophrenia
      that have investigated gamma-band activity are reviewed to gain insight into
      neural mechanisms associated with these deficits. We conclude that abnormalities 
      in gamma synchrony are ubiquitous in schizophrenia and likely reflect an
      elevation in baseline cortical gamma synchrony ('noise') coupled with reduced
      stimulus-evoked GBRs ('signal'). Such a model likely reflects hippocampal and
      cortical dysfunction, as well as reduced glutamatergic signaling with downstream 
      GABAergic deficits, but is probably less influenced by dopaminergic abnormalities
      implicated in schizophrenia. Finally, we propose that analogous signal-to-noise
      deficits in the flow of cortical information in preclinical models are useful
      targets for the development of new drugs that target the treatment-resistant
      symptoms of schizophrenia.

TI  - Functional brain imaging in schizophrenia: selected results and methods.
PG  - 181-214
AB  - Functional brain imaging studies of patients with schizophrenia may be grouped
      into those that assume that the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are due to
      disordered circuitry within a critical brain region and studies that assume that 
      the signs and symptoms are due to disordered connections among brain regions.
      Studies have investigated the disordered functional brain anatomy of both the
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Studies of spontaneous
      hallucinations find that although hallucinations are associated with abnormal
      brain activity in primary and secondary sensory areas, disordered brain
      activation associated with hallucinations is not limited to sensory systems.
      Disordered activation in non-sensory regions appear to contribute to the
      emotional strength and valence of hallucinations, to be a factor underlying an
      inability to distinguish ongoing mental processing from memories, and to reflect 
      the brain's attempt to modulate the intensity of hallucinations and resolve
      conflicts with other processing demands. Brain activation studies support the
      view that auditory/verbal hallucinations are associated with an impaired ability 
      of internal speech plans to modulate neural activation in sensory language areas.
      In early studies, negative symptoms of schizophrenia were hypothesized to be
      associated with impaired function in frontal brain areas. In support of this
      hypothesis meta-analytical studies have found that resting blood flow or
      metabolism in frontal cortex is reduced in schizophrenia, though the magnitude of
      the effect is only small to moderate. Brain activation studies of working memory 
      (WM) functioning are typically associated with large effect sizes in the frontal 
      cortex, whereas studies of functions other than WM generally reveal smaller
      effects. Findings from some functional connectivity studies have supported the
      hypothesis that schizophrenia patients experience impaired functional connections
      between frontal and temporal cortex, although the nature of the disordered
      connectivity is complex. More recent studies have used functional brain imaging
      to study neural compensation in schizophrenia, to serve as endophenotypes in
      genetic studies and to provide biomarkers in drug development studies. These
      emerging trends in functional brain imaging research are likely to help stimulate
      the development of a general neurobiological theory of the complex symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Cortical network analysis in patients affected by schizophrenia.

AB  - In the present study, we studied the structural changes of the brain functional
      network in a group of schizophrenic (SCHZ) patients during a 2-back working
      memory task. Cortical signals were obtained from scalp EEG signals through the
      high-resolution EEG technique, which relies on realistic head models and linear
      inverse solutions. Functional networks were estimated by computing the spectral
      coherence--i.e. a measure of synchronization in the frequency domain--between the
      time series of all the available cortical sources. To analyze those cortical
      networks we followed a theoretical graph approach by computing the network
      density as the total number of links and the node degree as the number of links
      of each cortical source. The major result suggest that in the Alpha2 frequency
      band (11-13 Hz) the cortical functional networks of the SCHZ patients present the
      largest differences when compared with those of a group of control (CTRL)
      subjects. In particular, the structure of the SCHZ network altered radically
      during the memory task, as the number of links that were different from the REST 
      condition increased sensibly with respect to the CTRL network. In addition, a
      compensatory mechanism was found in the SCHZ patients during the correct
      performance of the memory task where the node degree showed a frontal asymmetry
      with higher activation of the left frontal lobe--i.e. higher number of
      connections--in the Alpha2 frequency band.

TI  - Is there a cortical blood flow redistribution pattern related with perseverative 
      error in schizophrenia?
PG  - 283-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied relative cortical blood flow (relCBF) patterns associated 
      to correct performance (CP) and perseverative error (PE) during Wisconsin Card
      Sorting Test (WCST) execution, in controls and patients with schizophrenia.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: relCBF (regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) / whole cortex 
      blood flow) of 10 well defined cortical regions was measured in 18 patients with 
      schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls by a Technetium - 99 - HMPAO - SPECT, at
      rest and while they performed WCST. RESULTS: Patients made significantly more PE 
      than controls during WCST performance. In patients, we found a significant
      correlation between PE and relCBF in right occipital cortex. In controls, we
      found a significant correlation between CP and relCBF of several cortical regions
      during WCST execution: left orbitofrontal cortex and left global frontal cortex
      positively and parietal bilateral cortex negatively. PE was inversely correlated 
      with relCBF in left temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Successful WCST performance is 
      associated to a high left frontal activity in controls but not in patients. The
      severity of PE during WCST performance is associated to a low left
      frontal-temporal activity in controls and to a high right parietal-occipital
      activity in schizophrenia. This may represent a cortical activity redistribution 
      pattern related to perseveration in schizophrenia.

TI  - Hyperactivity and hyperconnectivity of the default network in schizophrenia and
      in first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1279-84
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0809141106 [doi]
AB  - We examined the status of the neural network mediating the default mode of brain 
      function, which typically exhibits greater activation during rest than during
      task, in patients in the early phase of schizophrenia and in young first-degree
      relatives of persons with schizophrenia. During functional MRI, patients,
      relatives, and controls alternated between rest and performance of working memory
      (WM) tasks. As expected, controls exhibited task-related suppression of
      activation in the default network, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and 
      posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Patients and relatives exhibited
      significantly reduced task-related suppression in MPFC, and these reductions
      remained after controlling for performance. Increased task-related MPFC
      suppression correlated with better WM performance in patients and relatives and
      with less psychopathology in all 3 groups. For WM task performance, patients and 
      relatives had greater activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      than controls. During rest and task, patients and relatives exhibited abnormally 
      high functional connectivity within the default network. The magnitudes of
      default network connectivity during rest and task correlated with psychopathology
      in the patients. Further, during both rest and task, patients exhibited reduced
      anticorrelations between MPFC and DLPFC, a region that was hyperactivated by
      patients and relatives during WM performance. Among patients, the magnitude of
      MPFC task suppression negatively correlated with default connectivity, suggesting
      an association between the hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity in
      schizophrenia. Hyperactivation (reduced task-related suppression) of default
      regions and hyperconnectivity of the default network may contribute to
      disturbances of thought in schizophrenia and risk for the illness.

TI  - Neuroimaging of cognitive disability in schizophrenia: search for a
      pathophysiological mechanism.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - This article reviews how functional neuroimaging research of cognitive
      dysfunction in schizophrenia has resulted in a progression of influential
      pathophysiological models of the disorder. The review begins with discussion of
      the 'hypofrontality' model, moving from resting studies examining anterior to
      posterior gradients of cerebral blood flow (CBF), to cognitive activation studies
      employing the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and current functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of working memory and cognitive control
      utilizing parametric task designs and event-related procedures. A similar
      progression is described for development of the temporal lobe model of
      schizophrenia, moving from research on the temporal cortex and language
      processing to the hippocampal formation and long-term memory (LTM). These LTM
      studies found that hippocampal dysfunction was often accompanied by disrupted
      prefrontal function, supporting a hybrid model of impaired fronto-temporal
      connectivity. Developments in image analysis procedures are described that allow 
      assessment of these distributed network models. However, given limitations in
      temporal and spatial resolution, current methods do not provide 'real-time'
      imaging of network activity, making arrival at a definitive pathophysiologic
      mechanism difficult. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) dysfunction and
      disrupted fronto-temporal integration appear to be equally viable current models.
      The article concludes with a discussion of how fMRI can help facilitate
      development of novel psychosocial and pharmacological interventions designed to
      improve cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - A single 20 mg dose of dihydrexidine (DAR-0100), a full dopamine D1 agonist, is
      safe and tolerated in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - The potential of dopamine D(1) receptor agonists to have beneficial effects on
      cognitive function has been suggested by a body of preclinical evidence. We now
      report the use of dihydrexidine (DAR-0100), the first full D(1) agonist, in a
      pilot study assessing single low dose safety and tolerability in patients with
      schizophrenia. A within-subject cross-over design was used in 20 adults (18-65
      years) with SCID-IV diagnosed schizophrenia. Subjects were outpatients with a
      moderate level of residual negative symptoms, and were on stable dosing of
      non-D(1)-blocking antipsychotic drugs. Following screening, subjects were
      hospitalized for 48 h, and at 0800 h each morning scanned on a 3 T MRI scanner
      for resting brain perfusion, followed by a Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)
      fMRI scan during an N-Back working memory task. They then received 20 mg
      subcutaneously (SC) of dihydrexidine or placebo over 15 min, followed by 45 min
      of intermittent MRI scans of perfusion and BOLD activity during the working
      memory task. Blood was drawn for serum drug levels and subjects were evaluated
      for clinical and cognitive changes. The procedure was repeated using the opposite
      challenge 2 days later. Dihydrexidine was well tolerated with no serious adverse 
      events although three subjects had mild dizziness and five subjects experienced
      nausea. There was no significant effect of drug on clinical interview ratings or 
      delayed (afternoon) neuropsychological performance. No medication interactions
      were seen. Thus, a single subcutaneous dose of dihydrexidine is tolerated and
      safe in patients with schizophrenia and does not produce delayed clinical or
      neuropsychological improvements.

TI  - Small-world networks and disturbed functional connectivity in schizophrenia.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Disturbances in "functional connectivity" have been proposed as a major
      pathophysiological mechanism for schizophrenia, and in particular, for cognitive 
      disorganization. Detection and estimation of these disturbances would be of
      clinical interest. Here we characterize the spatial pattern of functional
      connectivity by computing the "synchronization likelihood" (SL) of EEG at rest
      and during performance of a 2Back working memory task using letters of the
      alphabet presented on a PC screen in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy
      controls. The spatial patterns of functional connectivity were then characterized
      with graph theoretical measures to test whether a disruption of an optimal
      spatial pattern ("small-world") of the functional connectivity network underlies 
      schizophrenia. Twenty stabilized patients with schizophrenia, who were able to
      work, and 20 healthy controls participated in the study. During the working
      memory (WM) task healthy subjects exhibited small-world properties (a combination
      of local clustering and high overall integration of the functional networks) in
      the alpha, beta and gamma bands. These properties were not present in the
      schizophrenia group. These findings are in accordance with a partially inadequate
      organization of neuronal networks in subjects with schizophrenia. This method
      could be helpful for diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of the disease, as 
      well as understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying cognitive
      dysfunction in schizophrenia.

      METHODS: A detailed analysis of frontal gray and white matter volume correlations
      with Brodmann's area volumes in the rest of the cortex was undertaken in normal
      subjects (n = 42) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 106), divided into
      good-outcome (n = 52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian; n = 54) subtypes. RESULTS: 
      Frontal gray matter volumes were correlated with temporal lobe volumes in
      schizophrenics but not in normal subjects. Some frontal-parietal and
      frontal-occipital correlations showed a similar pattern. In comparison to normal 
      subjects, schizophrenia patients showed weaker or absent intercorrelations
      intrafrontally, specifically between left motor-premotor and eye-movement areas
      (4, 6, 8) and dorsolateral area 44, as well as between left areas 9 and 46 vs.
      area 24 (cingulate gyrus). Poor outcome among patients with schizophrenia was
      associated with weaker correlations between left frontal area 9 and both medial
      and lateral temporal cortices, as compared to normal subjects or good-outcome
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a structural component in the task or 
      symptom-related dysfunctional interactions between the frontal and more posterior
      cortical regions with preferential pathological involvement of frontotemporal and
      more limited involvement of frontoparietal and fronto-occipital systems in
      schizophrenia. Impaired regional associations within the frontal lobe, between
      left motor-premotor and Broca's areas, may play a role in language processing
      deficits in schizophrenia, while frontocingulate disconnection may result in
      working memory disturbances. Poor outcome may be associated with more widespread 
      disconnections between prefrontal vs. cingulate and temporal regions in the left 
      hemisphere, consistent with a disruption along the course of the left cingulum or
      uncinate bundles.

TI  - Anterior cingulate dysfunction during choice anticipation in schizophrenia.
PG  - 117-30
AB  - The anterior cingulate cortex (ACGC) participates in selective attention, working
      memory (WM), anticipation, and behavioral monitoring. Subjects with schizophrenia
      exhibit deficits in these mechanisms during selective attention and WM tasks.
      However, ACGC dysfunctions have not been specifically investigated during
      behavioral anticipation, whose deficits may relate to salient schizophrenic
      features such as foresight abnormalities and impaired social functioning and
      behavior. We thus studied ACGC function in relation to two aspects of WM,
      remembering information and anticipating responses, in control and schizophrenic 
      subjects. We measured brain activation in eight subjects with schizophrenia and
      eight healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging. All
      subjects performed stimulus-response delay tasks with color dots or facial
      expression diagrams as cues and either 50% or 100% response predictability, which
      emphasized demands on remembering the cues or anticipating the response for
      correct performance, respectively. We found a double dissociation of ACGC
      activation between subject groups and task type. In controls, the ACGC became
      intensely activated during response anticipation (more extensively and
      bilaterally when the cues were colors than when they were facial diagrams) but
      remained at resting activity levels during remembering. In schizophrenic
      patients, significant ACGC activation was seen only when remembering a percept
      (more extensively and bilaterally when it was a facial diagram than when it was a
      color) but not when anticipating a response. These results reveal an ACGC
      dysfunction during choice anticipation in schizophrenia and suggest that it might
      underlie the foresight deficits seen in schizophrenic patients.

TI  - The basal ganglia: anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology.
PG  - 757-99
AB  - The basal ganglia are perceived as important nodes in cortico-subcortical
      networks involved in the transfer, convergence, and processing of information in 
      motor, cognitive, and limbic domains. How this integration might occur remains a 
      matter of some debate, particularly given the consistent finding in anatomic and 
      physiologic studies of functional segregation in cortico-subcortical loops. More 
      recent theories, however, have raised the notion that modality-specific
      information might be integrated not spatially, but rather temporally, by
      coincident processing in discrete neuronal populations. Basal ganglia
      neurotransmitters, given their diverse roles in motor performance, learning,
      working memory, and reward-related activity are also likely to play an important 
      role in the integration of cerebral activity. Further work will elucidate this to
      a greater extent, but for now, it is clear that the basal ganglia form an
      important nexus in the binding of cognitive, limbic, and motor information into
      thought and action.

TI  - Cognitive peculiarities in relatives of schizophrenic and schizoaffective
      patients: heritability and resting EEG-correlates.
PG  - 201-16
AB  - The role of genetic factors in liability to schizophrenia is well established. It
      is supposed that different susceptibility genes produce distinct neurobiological 
      and behavioural phenotypes that may each increase the risk for developing
      schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to search for genetically and
      pathophysiologically independent domains of mild cognitive disturbances that
      might be the components of liability to schizophrenia. One hundred and
      twenty-seven adult relatives of schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients were
      tested with a battery of cognitive tasks. Results were subjected to a principal
      component analysis, and factors obtained were further investigated with
      behavioural genetic methods in 56 families of schizophrenics. Resting EEGs were
      recorded from a subsample of 66 relatives. Correlations of the cognitive factors 
      with absolute power values of seven frequency bands at 16 derivations were
      assessed using regression analysis. The study revealed four components of
      cognitive deficits in relatives of schizophrenics in domains of verbal short-term
      memory, thinking, communication and attention/working memory, all with
      substantive heritability except the last. The four components had a partial
      overlapping, but still distinct patterns of resting EEG correlates. The findings 
      are in line with the assumption that cognitive deficit in high-risk individuals
      may be decomposed to relatively independent dimensions, each with its specific
      genetic and pathophysiological background.

TI  - Functional neuroanatomy of sustained attention in schizophrenia: contribution of 
      parietal cortices.
PG  - 116-30
AB  - Deficits in sustained attention have been frequently described in schizophrenia. 
      The neuroanatomical basis reported previously have included altered levels of
      activation in cingulate and prefrontal cortex, but the contribution of further
      regions remains unclear. We explored the full neuroanatomy underlying the
      sustained attentional deficits observed in naive schizophrenics compared with
      controls. Participants included 10 controls and 11 patients. The experimental
      design included rest, auditory stimulation using clicks, and two counting tasks. 
      Subjects were instructed to mentally count the clicks, and then to count forward 
      at the same frequency they heard previously when listening to the clicks.
      Relative cerebral blood flow (relCBF) was measured by means of PET (15)O-water.
      Differences were observed between both groups at superior temporal cortex,
      superior parietal gyrus, and cerebellum during tasks requiring listening. During 
      all counting conditions, additionally to supplementary motor area (SMA),
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPCF), precentral gyrus, cingulate, cerebellum, 
      and inferior parietal (IP) gyrus, patients engaged other frontal structures
      including inferior, medial, and superior frontal areas. When counting with no
      auditory stimulation (C; requires components of working memory and time
      estimation), significant differences were observed in the level of activation of 
      frontal and IP regions. Our naive patients presented abnormal activation of
      auditory associative pathways. They failed to activate prefrontal and parietal
      regions at a similar level during tasks requiring increased cognitive effort, and
      they required a higher activation of inferior frontal regions to properly respond
      to cognitive demands.

TI  - MEG gamma band activity in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects in a
      mental arithmetic task and at rest.
PG  - 2079-87
AB  - OBJECTIVES: High frequency oscillations have been suggested as a correlate of
      cognitive processes and have recently also been implicated in aberrant forms of
      information processing. The present study investigated whether
      magnetoencephalographic (MEG) gamma band activity (20-71 Hz) can serve as an
      index of cognitive processes in the absence of external stimulation and to what
      extent gamma activity differs between healthy people and schizophrenia patients. 
      METHODS: The amount and topography of MEG power in the gamma band range was
      examined in 15 schizophrenia patients and 15 healthy comparison subjects while
      performing a complex mental arithmetic task and at rest. RESULTS: In healthy
      subjects a left frontal and left fronto-temporal increase in gamma power was
      observed during mental arithmetic. Schizophrenia patients either failed to
      display such a task effect (30-45 Hz) or had reversed lateralization with
      enhanced activity over right frontal and right fronto-temporal regions under
      cognitive demands (45-71 Hz). In the frequency band from 60 to 71 Hz patients
      showed less gamma at fronto-temporal, posterio-temporal and occipital sites
      irrespective of the task. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate, first, that gamma 
      topography can index cognitive activation in a very complex and purely internal
      task. Second, groups differed in the pattern of activation during the task, a
      result which may be consistent with working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia. 
      Third, the general topographic difference between healthy subjects and patients
      is in line with the notion of abnormalities in the thalamocortical circuit in
      schizophrenia.

TI  - An EEG approach to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia studying
      schizophrenics, normal controls and adolescents.
PG  - 57-73
AB  - Based on an integrative brain model which focuses on memory-driven and EEG
      state-dependent information processing for the organisation of behaviour, we used
      the developmental changes of the awake EEG to further investigate the hypothesis 
      that neurodevelopmental abnormalities (deviations in organisation and
      reorganisation of cortico-cortical connectivity during development) are involved 
      in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. First-episode, neuroleptic-naive
      schizophrenics and their matched controls and three age groups of normal
      adolescents were studied (total: 70 subjects). 19-channel EEG delta-theta, alpha 
      and beta spectral band centroid frequencies during resting (baseline) and after
      verbal stimuli were used as measure of the level of attained complexity and
      momentary excitability of the neuronal network (working memory). Schizophrenics
      compared with all control groups showed lower delta-theta activity centroids and 
      higher alpha and beta activity centroids. Reactivity centroids (centroid after
      stimulus minus centroid during resting) were used as measure of update of working
      memory. Schizophrenics showed partial similarities in delta-theta and beta
      reactivity centroids with the 11-year olds and in alpha reactivity centroids with
      the 13-year olds. Within the framework of our model, the results suggest
      multifactorially elicited imbalances in the level of excitability of neuronal
      networks in schizophrenia, resulting in network activation at dissociated
      complexity levels, partially regressed and partially prematurely developed. It is
      hypothesised that activation of age- and/or state-inadequate representations for 
      coping with realities becomes manifest as productive schizophrenic symptoms.
      Thus, the results support some aspects of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis.

      min positron emission tomography 15O-water measures of rCBF. Patients were worse 
      on both tasks. Controls activated inferior frontal, occipitotemporal, and
      temporal pole regions for both tasks. Similar results were obtained for controls 
      matched to level of patient performance. Patients showed no activation of
      hypothesized regions during the WCST and activated the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex during the PART. On the PART, occipitotemporal activation correlated with 
      better performance for controls only. Better WCST performance correlated with CBF
      increase in prefrontal regions for controls and in the parahippocampal gyrus for 
      patients. Results suggest that schizophrenia may involve a breakdown in the
      integration of a frontotemporal network that is responsive to executive and
      declarative memory demands in healthy individuals.

AB  - A wealth of clinical data indirectly implicate dysfunction of frontal cortex in
      schizophrenia, including negative symptoms, the pattern of neuropsychological
      deficits, and abnormal eye movements. Neuroimaging studies have provided direct
      evidence of frontal, particularly prefrontal, malfunction, but the results have
      been inconsistent and controversial. The burning question is whether prefrontal
      hypofunction is a pathophysiological characteristic of schizophrenia per se or an
      artifact of the imaging protocol. In studies of patients at rest,
      'hypofrontality' has been an inconsistent finding, probably because resting is
      physiologically and psychologically variable. Cognitive activation paradigms,
      especially during working memory tasks, have been reliable in showing prefrontal 
      hypofunction in patients, but these results have been challenged as artifacts of 
      poor performance. Performance differences have been addressed by studying
      patients and controls matched either for poor performance or for normal
      performance. The former approach, which has the potential of elucidating the
      specificity of physiological mechanisms associated with poor performance, has
      shown that prefrontal activity in patients with schizophrenia differs
      quantitatively and qualitatively from that of normals and of other patient
      populations who perform at a comparable level. The latter approach, which tends
      not to find prefrontal differences between patients and controls, may be
      selecting out important aspects of the disease by focusing on unaffected neural
      functions. While there are pitfalls to each approach and no single study can
      address all the potential phenomenological confounds, overall, the functional
      neuroimaging database in patients with schizophrenia suggests that prefrontal
      cognitive deficits are because of prefrontal pathophysiology and not the inverse.
