Our resutls showed reduced resting-sate functinal connectivity from the caudal LPFC to the left AI and left IFG, pars opercularis.The caudal LPFC is confirmed to be a core region responsible for higher level maniputaiton in working memory processes. It has a working memory load-dependent effect in the meta analysis (Rostchy, 2012), whereas the rostal LPFC was not.
This may indicate that the caudal LPFC was directly involved in manupilating the working memory storage. Another meta analysis find evidence for the consistent activation of LPFC across differeent putative executive functions (Nee, 2013).  A recent study (Barbalat,2011) oberserved impaired control from the left rostral LPFC to caudal LPFC in schizophrenia. Ealier study showed the activation in caudal LPFC regions negatively correlated with the disorganization syndrome score of patients(Barbalat, 2009). Although these findings are under the context of congnition control, there might be similar effect in working memory based on the fact that LPFC belong to a common network subserving a wide domain of cognitive tasks incuding working memory (Duncan, 2000). Our results support that there might me dysfunction in the cuadal LPFC when processing working memory items. The impairment may propagate down to the other frontal areas in a hierarchical working memory network.
